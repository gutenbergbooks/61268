<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>These lectures each had a set of associated slides, a complete
list of which can be found on pages <a href="#Page_143">143&ndash;152</a> at the end of the
book. These slide sets were sold separately and are not part of
the book. Some of the slides (those highlighted in <b>bold</b> in the
slide list) were inserted as illustrations in the original book,
and these are reproduced in this etext.</p>

<p class="screenonly">The numbers in the right margin of the etext are the numbers of
the associated slides. Several of these margin slide numbers are
in parentheses ( ) to indicate that this particular slide is being
shown for a second time at this point in the lecture. These margin slide numbers,
like the page numbers, are only displayed
on browsers; they are not displayed on handheld ereader devices.</p>

<p class="screenonly">If the window viewing size is made very wide, some slide numbers
might be overlaid on the next one; keeping the text width less than 120 characters
should avoid this.</p>

<p class="handonly">The original book showed all the slide numbers as sidenotes in the outer
margin of the text. These are not displayed on ereaders, but can be viewed in the .htm and .txt
versions of the etext.</p>

<p>There are no Footnotes in this book.</p>

<p>The original cover image has been slightly modified. It had damage in the top left
corner. This section of the cover image has been overlaid with a rotated version of
the top right corner section. This modified cover image was created by the transcriber
and is placed in the public domain.</p>

<p>Some minor changes to the text are noted at <a href="#TN">the end of the book</a>.</p>

<p class="p1 drop-capy">These Lectures, like the last series, have been
written for the Visual Instruction Committee of
the Colonial Office by Mr. A. J. Sargent, and have been
revised at the offices of the High Commissioners for
the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand. The
lecture on the Pacific has been revised by Sir Everard
im Thurn. The slides are derived from pictures painted
and photographs taken by Mr. A. Hugh Fisher on behalf
of the Committee, supplemented by photographs supplied
from various sources. The Committee wish to acknowledge
the great help which they have received from
the High Commissioners and Agents-General and their
staffs in the matter of slides, and in addition their
acknowledgments are due to, among others, the Honourable
Victor Nelson Hood, the Agricultural Departments
of Queensland and Western Australia, the Secretary to
the Commissioner for Queensland Railways, and the
Government Geologist of Western Australia.</p>

<p class="noindent">For nearly two thousand years the existence of a great
Southland, in the ocean of the southern hemisphere,
corresponding to the land mass of the Old World in
the northern, was a matter of doubt and dispute among
geographers. In the sixteenth century, this land
begins to appear vaguely on globes and charts; possibly
the information was due to the Malays and
Arabs, who were skilful sailors and made long voyages
in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It has been thought
that the Portuguese, approaching the Malay region
from the west, while the Spaniards came from the east,
may have been acquainted with the northern coast
of the new continent; since they certainly had some
knowledge of the northern coast of New Guinea early
in the sixteenth century. But our first definite information
may be said to date from the beginning of
the seventeenth century, when a Spanish exploring
expedition, under de Quiros and de Torres, sailed
across the Pacific and discovered the New Hebrides
group. One of the islands they named la Australia
del Espiritu Santo, under the idea that it formed
part of the great southern mainland. De Quiros then
sailed back to Mexico, but Torres continued his voyage
northwestward through the straits which still bear
his name, and so to the Spanish Possessions in the
Philippines.</p>

<p>But the day of Spain as a sea power was passing
away, and it was to the Dutch traders that the western
world owed its first real acquaintance with Australia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
The early discoveries were often accidental and did not
lead to settlement or regular intercourse with the
natives. This was due partly to the backward state
of the science of navigation, partly to the fact that
the voyagers on long expeditions usually lost from
half to three-quarters of their crews from disease. The
Dutch had the advantage of a local base, as they were
already firmly established in the East Indian Islands;
so that Australia was really discovered from the Indies.</p>

<p>Trade, not exploration, was the main motive of
the Dutch. So, in the early part of the seventeenth
century, trading ships were dispatched from Batavia
by the Dutch East-India Company to explore the
north and west coasts of Australia.</p>

<p>We find all along these coasts the names of the
ships still surviving, as in Arnhem Land and Cape
Leuwin; those of the captains, as in Dirk Hartog
Island, Houtmans Abrolhos, Edels Land and Nuyts
Land; while the Gulf of Carpentaria is a memorial
to Peter Carpenter, the then Governor of the great
trading company.</p>

<p>The most important voyage of all was that of Abel <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 1</span>
Tasman, in 1642. He started from Mauritius, to
discover a passage south of the Australian continent;
and after landing in Van Diemen’s Land, now
Tasmania, he sailed across the Tasman Sea and up
the west coast of New Zealand, and so back to
Batavia by way of Tonga and the Fiji islands and the
north coast of New Guinea. He left behind him another
name, New Holland, for the whole continent.</p>

<p>These names throughout Australasia bear witness to
the skill and energy of the Dutch navigators; but they
came only as traders, and the west coast of Australia,
which they knew best, had little to attract them to
permanent settlement. Sand and grass, hostile natives,
and dangerous reefs marked by a series of shipwrecks
sum up their impression of the new land. Here are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> <span class="linenum">2,3</span>
two views of the coast; it does not seem attractive for
sailors. We can quite understand why they made no
effort to open up a trade like that of the East Indies,
especially as they missed the east coast, the most
promising region for European settlement. Here are
two charts showing our knowledge of Australia, the
first soon after Tasman’s voyage, the second nearly a
century later. <span class="linenum">4,5</span></p>

<p>The discovery of the east coast was to come more
than a century later; it was made by an Englishman, at
a time when England was looking for new outlets, both
for trade and settlement, as an offset to her losses in the
continent of North America. It is true that Dampier
visited the west coast towards the end of the seventeenth
century, and wrote an account of the animals, natives,
and plants; but he does not seem to have been much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
more favourably impressed than the Dutch, and
nothing came of his visit.</p>

<p>But in the eighteenth century England and France
were the great rivals in colonisation, and voyages of
discovery and plans of annexation became the order
of the day. It was a revival, in a less forcible though
more scientific form, of the old rivalry with Spain and
Portugal in the sixteenth century. State influence
was behind the explorers, as it had been in the days
of Drake and his freebooters. Captain Cook sailed
in a ship belonging to the Royal Navy, and not in a
trader. In our own country his memory is still kept
green in the little port of Whitby where he served his
apprenticeship to the sea, and where the ships were
built in which he made his great voyages of discovery;
in the Antipodes it is for ever associated with the
beginnings of a great and growing Empire. Here we <span class="linenum">6,7</span>
see his statue in Sydney, and here is a picture of his
ship, the <i>Endeavour</i>, approaching New Zealand.</p>

<p>Cook came westward, across the Pacific, with an
expedition in 1769, to observe the Transit of Venus at
Tahiti, and then sailed south-west to New Zealand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 8</span>
He sighted land at Poverty Bay and sailed south as far
as Cape Turnagain; then he went right round the North
Island and through Cook Strait, until the Cape was again
sighted, scattering English names and charting the coast
as he passed. Next he circumnavigated the South Island,
steering outside Stewart Island, which he imagined to
be a peninsula; and so to Cape Farewell, in the north-west
corner of South Island. He had obtained a
fairly accurate idea of the nature of the coast, and had
proved that New Zealand was not connected with the
supposed Antarctic continent.</p>

<p>From Cape Farewell he struck westward, and sighted
the mainland of Australia at Point Hicks, on April 19th,
1770, but failed to discover Bass Strait. From Point
Hicks Cook sailed along the whole of the east coast to
Cape York, giving to the bays and capes as he passed
them the names of his crew, of British admirals, officials
and politicians of all kinds at home. At various landing
places he came into collision with the aborigines, and
at Endeavour River he stayed for two months to
repair his vessel which had been damaged through
striking on the rocks. Finally, before sailing westward
through Torres Strait, he landed on Possession Island
and formally claimed the whole region discovered for
the British Crown.</p>

<p>When, in 1798, Flinders and Bass proved that Van
Diemen’s Land was an island, the rough work of discovery
was complete. Australia, New Zealand and
many of the smaller islands were known and charted,
and the discoveries of the Spaniards and Dutch were
linked up, by the aid of a great deal of miscellaneous
exploration carried out by the French navigators who
followed us in the South of Australia, in New Zealand,
and in the islands of the Pacific.</p>

<p>The navigators, French and English, were in the
habit of formally annexing the country wherever they
landed; but annexation of this kind was of little value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
without effective occupation. This was to come later,
during the course of the next half century. From 1800
onwards, we may say that the different parts of this vast
region begin to have a separate and individual history
and development, though behind all are the conditions
common to most of the area, conditions which distinguish
it sharply from the rest of the world even to-day,
in spite of minor differences between its separate
parts. There is ample room for variation, since the
continent of Australia is about three-quarters the size
of Europe, or seven times the area of Germany and
France together; and it includes nearly every type
of temperate and tropical climate.</p>

<p>Whether we look at the animals, plants, or aborigines
of Australia, we are at once struck with the fact
that they belong to an entirely different order of life
from that which we find in the other great continents.
The whole region seems, from a very early age, to have
been cut off effectively from the rest of the world, and
to have developed along lines peculiar to itself; though
since the advent of the white man we have the artificial
introduction of European and other plants and
animals, which bid fair in many cases to oust the
native products, just as the white man has displaced
the original inhabitants.</p>

<p>The first animal which we naturally think of in
connexion with Australia is the kangaroo. His family <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 9</span>
is large and varied, from the giant standing six feet
high, and dangerous to attack, to the dwarf measured <span class="linenum">10</span>
by a few inches. He is a creature of the wide open
plains, living on grass, though in Queensland and New
Guinea are to be found some which climb the tall gum
trees and feed on their shoots. An ancestor of the
present kangaroo, whose remains have been discovered,
was a formidable monster standing twelve
feet high.</p>

<p>The kangaroo is merely the best known representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of a very large group, the marsupials or pouched animals.
Closely allied to the kangaroo is the wombat, a clumsy
badger-like animal which feeds on leaves and burrows in
the ground; he is quite harmless, though, like the
kangaroo, he had a huge ancestor who seems to have
been as large as a rhinoceros. The bandicoots, ratlike
burrowing animals, are his cousins many times removed.</p>

<p>Next we have a group which looks very different
but is really closely allied to the kangaroo: the <em>phalangers</em>,
or opossums, as they are commonly called. The <span class="linenum">11</span>
name is adopted from America but is applied in
Australia to the wrong group, as we shall see later.
Nothing is more misleading than the names given by
white settlers, ignorant of botany or biology, to native
plants or animals, generally on the ground of some
fancied and superficial resemblance. The so-called
opossums are found all over Australia and New
Guinea and in many of the islands of the Pacific;
but owing to the value of their fur they are becoming
scarce in many districts. They live in trees, and some
of the family have their legs connected by a membrane,
so that they can glide from one branch to
another. Hence the name flying squirrel; though
they do not fly and have no connexion with the
squirrel which we know. Here is another of the
same group, the <em>koala</em>, or native bear; though he
again has nothing to do with bears. He is a sleepy-looking <span class="linenum">12</span>
animal, with no tail, and is not given to
leaping or gliding; though his claws are useful for <span class="linenum">13</span>
climbing the gum trees in which he lives. He is
quite harmless, and a child can play with him, as
we see here.</p>

<p>Other members of the same great family are far from
harmless: among them are the <em>dasyures</em>, or native cats,
with dark bodies mostly spotted with white. Some
smaller members of this family are called weasels and
mice. To this family belongs also the Tasmanian Devil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> <span class="linenum">14</span>
whose portrait we have here; he is very fierce though
small. A larger animal, the size of a retriever, is the
so-called Tasmanian wolf; he is carnivorous, while most <span class="linenum">15</span>
of the marsupials are vegetarian. It is rather doubtful
whether he should be classed with the rest or go by
himself.</p>

<p>The only existing allies of the marsupials of Australia
are to be found in the opossums and some other
less known animals of South America; but the opossum
of South America resembles less his Australian namesake
than the other group, the <em>dasyures</em>. In Europe
and Asia the marsupials existed, but only in very remote
geological ages, as their remains prove. It has been
argued from the existence of the opossum family in
America that at some time there must have been a
land connexion between Australia and South America,
either by way of the islands of the Pacific or by an
Antarctic continent. But the isolation of Australia
must have been very ancient, since it has given time
for the development of the enormous differences which
we have seen among the individuals of the same
family.</p>

<p>Even these strange animals, old as they are, are
not the most primitive to be found in Australia. The
<em>ornithorhynchus</em> or duck-billed platypus lives in a <span class="linenum">16</span>
burrow by the river; it has teeth when young, but
seems to lose these as it grows up. It is said to lay
eggs like a reptile, though it is a true mammal. We
are not surprised to learn that when the first stuffed
specimen of this strange beast reached Europe it was
thought to be a fraud, put together to deceive the
ignorant and unwary. Another of these egg-laying
animals is the <em>echidna</em>, or spiny ant-eater, which has
a kind of beak for burrowing and a long sticky tongue
to capture its prey. It has sharp spines and rolls itself
into a ball like a hedgehog when attacked. In addition
to these curious animals there are rats and mice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and the dingo, or native dog, of a type more familiar <span class="linenum">17</span>
to us. It is thought possible by some that the dingo,
being so different from the other native animals, was
introduced by man at some very early date.</p>

<p>The typical Australian animals disappear as we
travel away through the islands to the north, and the
boundary line between Australia and Asia is usually
drawn through the strait between Bali and Lombok,
and then on between Celebes and Borneo; though it
is much disputed whether Celebes belongs to the one
region or the other. The division is only a narrow
water strait, and we can understand that Asiatic birds
would have no difficulty in crossing. On the other
hand, as there is no great land mass to the south,
there are no crowds of seasonal migrants from cooler
regions, such as we find in the warmer countries of the
northern hemisphere; so that the existing Australian
birds are for the most part allied to the bright-coloured <span class="linenum">18</span>
inhabitants of the tropics to the north. Some are
peculiar to the region, such as the lyre birds with their <span class="linenum">19</span>
wonderful tails, the emu, and the brush birds which
bury their eggs in a mound of earth, leaving them to
be hatched by the heat of the sun. Other birds, as
the honey-eaters, though common in Australia, are
found also in the neighbouring islands of the Pacific.
Unfortunately, not content with the flowers of the <span class="linenum">20</span>
gum trees, these birds now attack the fruit in the
orchards and are becoming a nuisance in some districts.
Finally we have the <em>kukuburra</em> or laughing-jackass, <span class="linenum">21</span>
one of the most popular and best known of all Australian
birds. It belongs to the kingfisher tribe and is
said to be a great destroyer of small snakes. Nor must <span class="linenum">22</span>
we forget the black swan, one of the most striking and
beautiful of all, and still to be found in large numbers
in the lakes of Gippsland and in West Australia.</p>

<p>Then we have lizards, snakes, and strange fish of
all kinds, some peculiar to Australia, others, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
animals, allied to species found in Asia or South
America. All the evidence afforded by the animal life
of the continent points to a very remote connexion
with the other continents, followed by a very long
period of isolation during which the families of animals
developed wide differences among themselves, together
with special peculiarities suited to the conditions in
which they lived.</p>

<p>Now let us turn for a moment from the animal to
the plant life of Australia. In the tropical parts of
Queensland there are many plants which belong to
the Malayan region as a whole; this we might expect.
We may see palms growing even at Brisbane; while <span class="linenum">23</span>
further north they form a dense forest, thoroughly
tropical in appearance, with its creepers and undergrowth,
as we see in these two pictures. But further <span class="linenum">24</span>
south we meet more species peculiar to Australia,
in the vegetable no less than in the animal world. <span class="linenum">25</span>
The typical Australian plants are those specially
adapted to resist hot sunshine with drought, and often
sudden changes of temperature. All over the continent
the gum trees give a special mark to the landscape <span class="linenum">26</span>
of the forest. The leaves hang vertically, so
as not to give a large exposure of surface to the
hot sun, and are collected in dense clusters for the
same purpose of protection; so that we miss much
of the spreading shade of our English trees. The
leaves, too, are alike on both sides, and the colour
is more uniform than in our own trees, nor do they
change colour and fall in autumn, but decay gradually
on the stalk. The bark of many of the gums hangs
in strips, thus spoiling the appearance of the huge
trunk, for huge it is, rising to four hundred feet in
some species. Owing to the character of the foliage
the forests are more open than our own, except in
the wetter parts where there is a dense undergrowth
of fern and creeper. These districts are always near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the coast. As we travel away from the coast the forest
thins out, except along the watercourses, and becomes <span class="linenum">27</span>
smaller and more stunted. In place of trees with leaves
we find thorny scrub of various kinds, such as the <span class="linenum">28</span>
mulga, whose leaves are replaced by woody spikes still
more resistant to drought. Finally we reach the salt-bush <span class="linenum">29</span>
and spinifex and wiry grasses of the desert
interior. Often there is little but bare rock as in the <span class="linenum">30</span>
pictures before us. The watercourses themselves may
dry up in the hot season, leaving a desolate expanse <span class="linenum">31</span>
of sand and stones, but the line of trees still marks
the presence of moisture below. <span class="linenum">32</span></p>

<p>The huge gum trees are, as a rule, the main feature
in the forest landscape, but this is varied by curiosities
like the grass tree and the bottle tree; while in the
moister regions, as in the forests of Gippsland, we find <span class="linenum">33</span>
beautiful tree ferns of every kind. Here are specimens
of grass trees and gums. Everywhere we <span class="linenum">34</span>
find the acacia and the wattle with its sweet scent,
the banksia shooting up into great trees, and the <span class="linenum">35</span>
beautiful waratah; everywhere, too, where the rainfall
is sufficient, flowers of the same order as those
with which we are familiar in Europe grow in great
profusion.</p>

<p>So we see that there is great variety of vegetation
in Australia, though the only native plants of much
use to man are the gum trees, which we value for their
dense hard woods. All else that is of value, both
among plants and animals, has been introduced by
the settlers, and many of the native types seem doomed
to extinction.</p>

<p>We may now be able to understand why this country
of strange plants and animals had no attraction for
the Dutch trader, especially in the drier west; in fact,
it could have no trade until it had been settled by
Europeans bringing with them European crops and
animals. In India and Malaya there was already a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
basis for trade in some of the natural products of the
region; while the natives were sufficiently advanced in
civilisation to make commercial intercourse possible.
It was far otherwise in Australia. The aborigines, as
we found them, were as primitive as the plants and
animals. They are not black, but a dark-brown people,
and their hair is waved and silky, not curly like that of
the negro. They are different also from the negro
in the shape and build of the head and face. There
are various theories as to their origin, but the nearest
correspondence seems to be in some of the ancient hill
tribes of India and the Veddas of Ceylon. At any rate
they are quite different from the Malays, and equally
also from the now extinct Tasmanians. The Tasmanians
had woolly hair, and perhaps represented the
remnants of an earlier and even less developed race
than the invaders from the north.</p>

<p>The native Australian, as the first European discoverers
found him, was not an attractive being. He
was looked on as little better than a wild beast and
treated as such. This was partly due to ignorance
of his language and customs. His mode of life was
fitted by long adaptation to the peculiar conditions of
his surroundings. He had developed no agriculture
in his new home; not without reason, if we think of
the agricultural possibilities of the country in the
hands of a rude and backward people. He was equally
without any of the useful animals, and had no means of
procuring them. So he was reduced to the nomad
life and to the utilisation of the wild roots and plants
of the country and such small game as he could kill
with his rude weapons. He was necessarily a hunter,
with a temporary shelter for his home, often an overhanging <span class="linenum">36</span>
rock as in this picture; and civilisation does not
grow up in such conditions. Here we see some natives <span class="linenum">37</span>
fishing, and here again are some armed men scouting in
the bush.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> <span class="linenum">38</span></p>

<p>The hostility of the native to the European colonists
often arose from their interference with his natural
food supply, or to their careless ignorance of his semi-religious
ideas or customs, such as the tabu.</p>

<p>His only possible clothes were the skins of animals,
and his weapons and tools all belonged to the Stone Age.
The axe, knife, and hammer were in universal use, and
long journeys were made to obtain the right kind of
stone. This involved a certain amount of intercourse
among the tribes. For weapons of offence the native
had the club, and the spear tipped with bone or stone;
while some tribes used a special spear-thrower. The
boomerang was a curved bar of heavy wood, often five
or six feet long, which was used for killing or stunning
at a short distance. The smaller boomerang, which
returns to the thrower, was merely a toy and used in
sport; here we see it in use. The stone implements are <span class="linenum">39</span>
all similar to those which are dug up in Europe, the
relics of the Neolithic Age of man. One of the chief
uses of the axe was to cut notches for climbing trees, in
search of honey among other things; though they had <span class="linenum">40</span>
another method which we see here.</p>

<p>The natives were divided into tribes and sub-tribes,
and had some form of tribal government, under headmen.
In the south-east of the continent these chiefs
had considerable authority and were sometimes treated
by us as representing the tribe. Here is one of them,
though he does not look imposing in his European dress. <span class="linenum">41</span>
They had an elaborate social system and curious
marriage customs about which the learned still dispute.
They had a strong belief in spirits of various kinds,
though it could hardly be called a religion, and a whole
series of tales and legends handed down orally, some
of them showing considerable power of imagination. <span class="linenum">42</span>
They even had the beginnings of some ideas of art and
ornament, as we can judge from the crude paintings <span class="linenum">43</span>
shown here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The most interesting of their social customs was the
corroboree, a great gathering for feasting and dancing, <span class="linenum">44</span>
often combined with some religious or social ceremony.
Such meetings represented the only real social intercourse
of the people and tribes, except messages by
ambassadors who were sacred everywhere.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, they were not so low in the scale
of civilisation as the early observers imagined. Even
the language, with its many dialects, due to the
absence of writing and the nomad life of the people, is
elaborate and inflected like those of Europe.</p>

<p>The native life in its original form is decaying, and
survives chiefly in the interior and the west. Wherever
white occupation has extended, the native is dying out;
in fact, in some parts he survives only on the Government <span class="linenum">45</span>
Reservations. Here are some of these survivors
in Victoria. Here again, in Queensland, we see the <span class="linenum">46</span>
native converted to European clothes, though he does
not seem very comfortable in them. In this district, <span class="linenum">47</span>
as in South and Western Australia, and the Northern
Territory, they still exist in considerable number; but
it is probable that there are less than 100,000 in all in the
Commonwealth. In the census of 1911 an attempt was
made to count them, and some 20,000 were found to be
living in or near white settlements; only a vague
estimate was possible in the case of the tribes of the
interior, who still live their nomadic life in the more
inaccessible parts of the country. But the area untouched
by the white man grows smaller every year,
and unless the native can change his character greatly,
he is likely to die out in the north and west as in
the south-east. In 1911 there were only about two
thousand in New South Wales, hardly any in Victoria,
and none at all in Tasmania. It was inevitable that
the Australian native should be displaced from his
hunting grounds. An area about equal to that of the
United States could not be left in the sole occupation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of a few thousand savages. Now, instead of the savage
with his primitive tribal system, we have a white race,
purely British in origin, with industry and agriculture of
the most advanced type, and an elaborate political constitution
of federated States. It is the utilisation, by
the white man, of the resources of this vast area which
we must study.</p>

<p>We have seen something of the coast of this area;
let us now try for a moment to picture it as a whole.
The map shows us an oblong block, which lies east and <span class="linenum">48</span>
west, on either side of the Tropic of Capricorn. On
the north, two peninsulas, Arnhem Land and Cape
York, project towards the Equator; between them is
the Gulf of Carpentaria, the only deep indentation in
the whole continent. On the south, Victoria, continued
by Tasmania, stretches into the cool waters of
the Southern Ocean. A coastal plain, broad in the
north, narrow elsewhere, fringes a plateau which occupies
the greater part of the oblong. The plain is narrowest
in the east, and the plateau edge most marked, so that
it resembles a series of mountain ranges. Rivers, short
for the most part, plunge down the seaward edge of
the plateau. The only large area of lowland is in the
south-east, drained by a group of long rivers and shared
by four of the Australian States. Some of these rivers
lose themselves in the salt lakes and marshes of the
inland basin of Lake Eyre; the rest, gathered up by
the Murray, reach the sea at the one point where the
plateau rim disappears. The tropical lowlands, the temperate
coast-plains, the plateau and the long inward
slopes of the Murray system are the main features which
we shall find recurring in the geography of the various
States.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So far we have dealt only with Australia. New
Zealand shows to some extent the peculiarities which
mark Australia off from the rest of the world, but on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the whole the differences between these two sections
of Australasia are more noticeable than the likeness.
We might anticipate this, since the dominant fact in
the development of the peculiar plant life of Australia
is drought; in the case of New Zealand it is moisture. <span class="linenum">49</span>
Again, New Zealand has no snakes, and lacks the
peculiar animals which we have seen in Australia.
In fact, its only native animals are a bat and a rat,
the latter perhaps introduced by the Maoris. To
compensate for this it has a large group of birds peculiar
to itself, including the wingless birds, which may have
lost their wings since they had no need for flight from
enemies on the ground. The best known of these birds
is the <em>kiwi</em>; here we see him in his natural haunts. <span class="linenum">50</span>
Again, there is the <em>takahe</em>, which was at one time
thought to be extinct; but one or two specimens have
been found, and there may be others still existing.
Here is one of these stuffed. Finally there is the <span class="linenum">51</span>
gigantic <em>moa</em>, which probably existed at the time of
Captain Cook’s voyage. Now we can only see its skeleton, <span class="linenum">52</span>
but naturalists have attempted to re-construct the
whole bird, as we see here. One link New Zealand <span class="linenum">53</span>
possesses with a very remote geological past; this
is the curious <em>tuatara</em> or three-eyed lizard. He belongs <span class="linenum">54</span>
to an extinct group of reptiles which lived in Europe
many ages ago and is now only represented in the
fossils which we dig up. So we see that in its animal
life New Zealand differs from Australia and from the
rest of the world; we shall find also a strong contrast
between the native races of the two countries in their
character and origin, their relations with the white
settlers, and their influence on the history and development
of the land which they possessed before our
arrival.</p>

<span class="fs80">NEW SOUTH WALES</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">When, in 1770, Captain Cook dropped anchor in Botany
Bay, he just missed discovering the finest harbour in
the world. Voyaging northwards he sighted Port
Jackson in the distance but did not examine it more
closely, and the discovery was left to the first party
of colonists, a few years later. The harbour which
we are going to explore was the scene of the first real
settlement, and is still the vital centre for the whole
of New South Wales.</p>

<p>We steam through a broad channel, nearly a mile
wide between the rugged points which guard it.
There is no lack of room here for ships to pass one <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 1</span>
another, and our large vessel seems quite insignificant
beside the towering cliffs. On our right is a broad
bay, the North Harbour, with the village of Manly at
its head; on the other side of Manly, across a narrow
isthmus, is the open ocean, with its long rollers thundering
always in surf upon the beach. But inside the
Heads the water is calm as a lake. In front of us,
and beyond the North Harbour, is a narrow, winding
inlet, running for miles into the hills; this is Middle <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 2</span>
Harbour. There is plenty of good anchorage here,
but it is mainly given up to pleasure boats; we are
a long way yet from the commercial harbour. To
reach this our vessel turns sharply southwards, behind
the South Head with its lighthouses, and steams on <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 3</span>
for about five miles up the Main Harbour. All along,
on either hand, are jutting headlands, and in the bays
between, especially on the south side, are seaside villages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
But we shall not see swarms of bathers on the beaches
as in our own country, for there are sharks in Sydney
Harbour; the only safe bathing is in the surf outside.
As we approach our landing-place the houses are more
closely packed together, and islands are dotted here
and there in the channel. We may be reminded to
some degree of parts of the Clyde, or of one of the
larger inlets on the west coast of Scotland; though
here we find not only the most beautiful scenery but a
great seaport and busy city in the very midst of it.</p>

<p>We turn at last into Sydney Cove, on the south
side of the harbour, and here we are moored at Circular <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 4</span>
Quay in the very heart of the city. Further on to the
west, just round the next point, we see Darling Harbour, <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 5</span>
crowded with shipping, and its busy wharves piled with
merchandise. The waterway extends some miles further
inland, but here in Sydney Cove is the centre of commercial
activity and the landing-place of the original
settlers in 1788.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i030.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Port Jackson.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Before we land let us look at a chart which shows
us the long passage by which we have entered, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 6</span>
windings of the harbour and the city spreading over
the surrounding hills. This will give us our bearings
and help us to understand the views.</p>

<p>We will now land, climb the hill, and look down on <span class="linenum">(4)</span>
the Cove. There, on the further side, is our vessel,
lying close to the tall warehouses. Beyond it are the
trees of Government Domain, with the tower and roof
of Government House showing above them. The little
bay on our left is Farm Cove, where the warships lie <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 7</span>
at anchor; and beyond it again, on the next point, we
see the trees of the Botanical Gardens. Then we have
Woolloomooloo Bay, running up to a new and crowded
suburb, and in the distance many more points and bays,
as we look along the south side of the harbour back
towards the sea. Or let us climb up behind our vessel,
in another direction, to the library, and look down
over Farm Cove. Below us, on the little island, is <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 8</span>
Fort Denison; and across the water on the north side
is Mossman Bay, where a new Sydney is growing up.
It is all very different from the crowded ugliness of
most of our own commercial cities.</p>

<p>To see something of the inside of the city we walk
up George Street from the quayside. On our right is
old Sydney, irregular and picturesque, built on the
rocky peninsula between Sydney Cove and Darling
Harbour. Here is a view of one of the old streets. <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 9</span>
George Street itself is very modern in appearance, with
its broad roadway, electric cars, and handsome stone <span class="linenum">10</span>
buildings. Here is the Post Office at one of the corners;
it is built of sandstone and granite which are to be <span class="linenum">11</span>
found in abundance in the local rocks. Across George
Street runs Bridge Street, one of the oldest in the city.
It takes its name from the old bridge across the little
Tank stream, which has now been absorbed into the
underground drainage of the city, like so many of
our old streams in London. There are many Government
buildings in this older part as we might expect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and at the top is the entrance to Government
House.</p>

<p>On the west side of Darling Harbour is the suburb
of Pyrmont, on another peninsula; and at the base
of these peninsulas Sydney is spreading and broadening
out beyond the railway station. But even here, in
the new suburb, are many parks and open spaces
reserved for public use; while nothing can destroy
the beauty of the older portion of the city, divided up
by inlets, and with glimpses down many of its sloping
streets of the blue water and the hills beyond. It is
not surprising that the early settlers found this spot
far more attractive than the open beach of Botany Bay.</p>

<p>As we look down on the Cove and its neighbourhood,
we must remember that we have in front of us only a
small part of the great expanse of landlocked anchorage
available in the harbour; there is still room for unlimited
growth, though Sydney has already over a
third of the total population of New South Wales
collected in and around it.</p>

<p>We must now look beyond the actual harbour, and
try to place ourselves in the position of the early settlers.
We have great distances to cover, since New South
Wales is just half as large again as France; we must
therefore keep fairly closely to the railway; but we
shall not lose much by this as the railway will carry
us through all the important districts of the State.</p>

<p>We may travel north, south, or west, and the map
can give us some idea of the character of the country <span class="linenum">12</span>
through which we shall pass. Sydney lies near the
middle of a long strip of coastland, shut in on its western
side by the steep edge of a great plateau. In the
neighbourhood of Sydney this edge goes by the name
of the Blue Mountains. Here the barrier is about
forty miles inland; further north, in the valleys of
the Hunter and Hawkesbury rivers, the lowland
widens out to nearly a hundred miles; while in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
parts of the south the highlands come right down to
the sea. This narrow strip was the original New
South Wales.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">New South Wales and Victoria: Orographical</span>.<br />
<em>By permission of the Diagram Co.</em></div>
</div>

<p>We can travel now by railway along the coast strip <span class="linenum">13</span>
to Newcastle, then up the valley of the Hunter, and
finally climb the Liverpool Range on to the plateau
beyond. But the journey was far from easy for the
early settlers. In fact, until 1820, when a stock route was
discovered from Sydney to Newcastle, the only intercourse
with the north was by sea, and Newcastle grew
up almost as a separate colony in consequence. The
valleys of the Hunter and other rivers gave a natural
direction to early settlement, since in their lower
courses they flow through wide alluvial flats which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
very fertile and easy to cultivate. But they are
subject sometimes to devastating floods, as the settlers
found to their cost, while the heavy summer rainfall
is not well suited to certain of our crops, such as
wheat. So in the early days the colony was often
in difficulty as to its main food supply.</p>

<p>The name Newcastle at once suggests coal; and
coal is everywhere in this district. The surface of the
country round Sydney is largely a barren sandstone;
but underlying the whole of the area, from Newcastle
on the north to Bulli on the south, and extending
westward to the other side of the plateau edge, is a
vast coalfield. Its chief development at present is
around Newcastle. Here is a view of Hetton colliery, <span class="linenum">14</span>
Newcastle; both the name and the picture remind
us strongly of the North of England. We see the coal
being wound up from the shaft as in our own mines,
and in the distance vessels lying at the wharves in the
fine harbour. Here again is a general view of the <span class="linenum">15</span>
harbour in which we can clearly distinguish the loading
of the coal and merchandise.</p>

<p>A journey southward from Sydney to the other end
of the coalfield will bring us to a less familiar type of
mine. At Clifton the early explorers found coal
strewn on the beach; the actual seam is in the face
of the cliff, and shows as a broad black band, while <span class="linenum">16</span>
the coal is mined by means of adits, and then run
on to the little pier to be shipped. The coal is found
under Sydney itself, and mining is now in progress
on the south side of the harbour; but the shafts are
much deeper here than at Newcastle, since the coal
measures lie in the shape of a saucer, and Sydney is
near the middle. We may notice here that the southern
railway line ends at Nowra on the Shoalhaven river,
and beyond are only a few small coast towns; so we
need not at present explore further in this direction.</p>

<p>We will now leave the coast district for a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and climb the plateau edge to survey the country
beyond. First let us consider the nature of the obstacle
by which the early settlers were faced. The Blue
Mountains are merely a part of the eastern rim of a
great tilted tableland of sandstone, with a steep face
towards the sea and a long and more gentle slope
towards the west. Down this face a series of comparatively
short streams come tumbling to the sea; while
on the other side of the ridge, almost within sight of
the sea, are the sources of the slow westward-flowing
rivers, whose courses are measured by thousands of
miles.</p>

<p>In this sandstone block the torrents have carved
out deep gorges, which often widen out up-stream
into broad valleys; but these valleys are deceptive
and do not provide a road to the interior, since they <span class="linenum">17</span>
end in steep cliffs over which the streams plunge in
waterfalls. Here is a view of the country at Govett’s <span class="linenum">18</span>
Leap; we may notice the flat tops of the ridges, all
about the same level, which suggest the old surface
of a plateau. It was a long time before the early
settlers found a path over this edge, and the available
roads are still very few all along its length, as we may
see by tracing them on the map; our train must twist
and tunnel up one of the ridges between two of the
valleys by a most difficult route, with steep inclines,
instead of following the bank of the stream below.
We realise that climbing a plateau is a far more serious
matter for the engineer than piercing through a narrow
ridge of mountains.</p>

<p>At Victoria, on our way up, we leave the train for
a coach drive, to Jenolan. Here the scenery changes;
the rock is no longer sandstone, but limestone, and the
streams have burrowed out many curious gorges and
underground channels as in our own Derbyshire.
Here we have one of these in the form of a huge rock <span class="linenum">19</span>
archway through which we catch a glimpse of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
country beyond; while far down below us flows the
stream which bored out the arch. A little further on
we find the stream running at the bottom of a lofty <span class="linenum">20</span>
cavern, and out into a deep and narrow gorge. Here
again is a view of the interior of one of these caverns,
with its huge pillars hanging from the roof and rising
up from the floor. These limestone tunnels and <span class="linenum">21</span>
gorges, and the sandstone valleys with their steep
surrounding cliffs and narrow outlets, are a fine
subject for the artist and tourist in search of
beauty, but do not suggest opportunities for settlement
or farming; at the same time they are evidently
a serious obstacle to movement. The bare
surface of the plateau is little better; in fact, the highlands
in this district are still among the most thinly
populated areas in New South Wales, in spite of their
nearness to the capital and the oldest settlements.
So we pass through quickly, and coming out by a <span class="linenum">22</span>
long tunnel drop down to Lithgow, where we enter an
entirely different kind of country. Lithgow is a
manufacturing town, with coal mines, ironworks,
smoke and dirt. It really belongs to the coast region,
and is here, on the inside of the ridge, only because a
small piece of the Newcastle coalfield, which underlies
all the country which we have been crossing, crops
out in this district from under the sandstone. On
our journey inland we shall not meet with any other
town of the same type, as we are now entering the
great wheat-belt of Eastern Australia.</p>

<p>Here is a typical farm on the eastern edge of the <span class="linenum">23</span>
wheat-belt. Beyond the hills, which we see in the
background, is the steep descent to the Hunter valley
and the coastal plain. The hills are wooded, but the
trees thin out and the ground becomes more open as
we go westward down the long slope. We must not
forget that here at the back of the plateau edge, though
we are on the “Plains,” yet we are still more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
thousand feet above the level of the sea. We shall
realise the importance of this height later. Our next
picture shows a wide expanse of level ground, under <span class="linenum">24</span>
grain, with the reapers at work. We are at Tamworth
on the Liverpool Plains, not far from the northern end
of the wheat-belt; but this belt can be traced from
Queensland right round to South Australia, and from
end to end the scenery is the same. There are the
same open sunny plains, dotted with homesteads and
small agricultural towns, and covered with the waving
grain. Everywhere is the hum of machinery, reaping,
binding, and threshing; for labour here is costly and as
little as possible is done by hand. We may find it
hard to tell, from the appearance of the country,
where we are within a thousand miles, and we may
be struck by the monotony of the view as we rush
through it. None the less this great field of grain is
impressive in its own fashion, if we use our imagination
and follow the heavily loaded waggons to the station,
and on to Sydney, and so across the ocean to London or
Liverpool, until the grain appears as bread in the
baker’s shop. We are watching here the beginning
of the process by which the crowded millions of
Industrial Europe are fed; and the wide spaces under
crop may give us some idea of the greatness of the
business; for we have in the wheat-belt of Australia,
in spite of its great extent, only a small fraction of the
wheatfields of the world.</p>

<p>A rainfall map is the best aid to the understanding
of the position and extent of the wheat area. The <span class="linenum">25</span>
map is arranged in a series of parallel zones, which
show the annual fall decreasing rapidly on the west
side of the Divide, as we move further away from the
coast. We are crossing one of these zones where the
fall is from twenty to twenty-five inches, or not far
removed from that of the eastern counties of England.
This is the wheat-belt of Eastern Australia, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
follows the rainfall right round the inner slope of the
plateau as far as South Australia.</p>

<p>This zone gradually shades off into another rather
broader where the rainfall is much lower; from ten
to twenty inches at most. So the scenery changes as
we travel westward until we are lost in the country
of the western plains: a great dry lowland not far
above sea-level, and drained by slow-moving rivers,
the Lachlan, Darling, Murray and their tributaries.
The railway runs north-westward, through interminable
miles of grass and scrub, until it ends at Bourke,
the head of navigation on the Darling. It is the land
of the sheep and nothing else. We may gain some idea
of the enormous extent of land in this part of Australia,
available for pasture or agriculture in some form, by
placing upon it for comparison the eastern part of the
United States, as in the map which we see here. <span class="linenum">26</span></p>

<p>New South Wales possesses nearly as many sheep as
the rest of Australia together, and most of these are
to be found on the inland slope of the plateau and far
out into the plains, more especially in the Riverina
district, between the Murray and the Murrumbidgee.
We have left behind us the wheatfield and the reapers;
the loaded waggons which we pass, drawn by long teams <span class="linenum">27</span>
of horses, are carrying great bales of wool to the railway.
We may follow the wool back to the shearing sheds <span class="linenum">28</span>
where again all the work is done by machinery; then
we go on to the sorting shed, and so to the railway and
the showrooms at Sydney, where thousands of samples <span class="linenum">29</span>
are displayed for the benefit of the buyers for the
markets of Europe. We can see the great flocks of
sheep before and after the shearing at the homestead <span class="linenum">30</span>
or follow them as they are driven to pasture; and
everywhere in this great river plain we find the same
thing repeated. The rainfall is not sufficient for
agriculture; but in ordinary years it will provide good
grass for the sheep; and there is also the drought-resisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
salt-bush to eke it out. Sometimes the rain
fails, and then there is neither food on the ground nor
water in the creeks and pools, and millions of sheep
die, as in the great drought of 1901&ndash;2. The dry
climate gives the best wool in the world, but it is not
without its drawbacks; though the large profits made
by the farmer in ordinary years more than compensate
for an occasional period of drought.</p>

<p>The uncertainty of the rainfall shows itself in
another way, in the peculiarities of the rivers. Of
all the great rivers in this basin, the Murray alone, fed
by the melting snows of the Australian Alps, has a
good supply of water at all seasons; the rest are variable.
The Darling, Lachlan and Murrumbidgee are navigable
for long distances in favourable seasons, and sometimes
are flooded and overflow their banks, turning the
surrounding country into a huge shallow lake; but
at other times they become, in places, little more than <span class="linenum">31</span>
strings of detached pools. Here is a lagoon on the
Murrumbidgee, and here is the Murray evidently in <span class="linenum">32</span>
flood, to judge from the trees growing out of the
water; another view shows us the river in its ordinary <span class="linenum">33</span>
state. By way of contrast here is a small
creek in the Riverina district; the road crosses it by <span class="linenum">34</span>
a ford, so that it is evidently not very deep, and would
soon dry up. But after heavy rains, further up-country,
the creek may become for a short time a roaring
torrent. Settlers new to the country have often made
the mistake of camping in the evening on the near
side of a creek of this kind, only to find in the morning
that the ford has vanished and that they must stay
where they are until the water subsides. One of the
most remarkable features in Australian weather is this
sudden change from drought to flood, which not only
transforms the rivers but in a few days gives a covering
of rich green pasture where before was a parched
desert supporting only the hardy salt-bush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>When the rivers are full we can see the shallow draught
steamers collecting wool and other products; but the <span class="linenum">35</span>
want of water is not the only drawback. The rivers
wind greatly in their courses over the level plain, so
much so that at one place it is said that the steamer
takes a whole day to pass a particular house, owing to
the river bending right back upon itself. The river
banks are marked by lines of gum trees, by which the
eye can trace them for many miles across the level.
Except for this, the whole area crossed by these rivers
in their lower courses is one vast treeless plain, covered
with grass and scrub in the rains, but at other times
dry, dusty, and monotonous. It extends into Queensland
and Victoria, but its greatest development is in
New South Wales: for though the other colonies have
large flocks of sheep, it is here that sheep-raising is the
one industry above all others; in fact, under ordinary
conditions, no others are profitable or even possible.
In this country, next to the sheep, water is the most
valuable commodity.</p>

<p>The greater part of the Murray-Darling basin is
filled up by recent rock sediment and river alluvium;
but the narrow belt of country with a moderate
rainfall, lying between the plateau edge and the
western plains, has not depended for its development
solely on agriculture. All along it the older rocks
crop out, and in the older rocks we find the valuable
minerals in which Australia abounds.</p>

<p>Gold, in its alluvial form, occurs all along the
agricultural belt; and since the time of the first
discovery near Bathurst, in 1851, the search for gold
has often caused an inrush of people who have abandoned
mining for the more secure and pleasant business of
growing wheat or rearing sheep. Though much gold
is still produced, New South Wales is not by any means
the chief of the States to-day in this respect; but
gold has been woven deeply into her history. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the most usual methods of obtaining gold is still by
dredging alluvium; but in place of the shovel and
washing-pan we have the ugly machine dredger scooping
out the creeks and flats where the gold is to be found.
We must look elsewhere for gold-mining from the
rock on a large scale; though this is increasing in New
South Wales in connexion with the development of
mining for other minerals, especially copper.</p>

<p>Well out in the plains, and south of Bourke, at the
end of a branch line of railway, is the town of Cobar;
it stands just where the old rocks are disappearing
underneath the recent deposits. Here is one of the chief
centres of copper mining; and, once the work was
started, mining for other ores naturally followed.
It is a desolate country, rendered more so by the nature
of the industry. The furnaces for the rough smelting
of the ores need fuel, but coal is far away; so that the
country round has been stripped of its small supply
of timber, and has nothing left to relieve its ugly
monotony. The ore, partly worked, is sent by rail
all the way to Lithgow, on the coalfield, to undergo
the further process of refining. The importance of
these mining fields to the State lies not so much in the
money value of the products as in the fact that they
give rise to railways and traffic and so to a further
spread of the settled agricultural population. The
minerals, and especially gold, have played a great part
in the settlement of the less accessible or less attractive
regions of Australia.</p>

<p>The old rocks, which disappear at Cobar, under
the alluvium of the Murray basin, crop out again at the
surface in the far west, and give us one of the chief silver-producing
areas of the Continent. The natural outlet
of the district is by Spencer Gulf, as Sydney is more
than twice as far away; and the development of these
mines has been largely due to the people and capital of
South Australia. Here is one of the most famous mines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> <span class="linenum">36</span>
at Broken Hill; and here we have the camel team, the
only means of transport away from the railway. We <span class="linenum">37</span>
are in the semi-desert area, and the existence of the
mining population is only made possible by collecting
the water from the neighbouring hills in great reservoirs, <span class="linenum">38</span>
such as we see in the picture before us.</p>

<p>We have still to see the south-east corner of the
State, where we shall find some of the most picturesque
scenery and a country rather different from that
which we have so far visited. We take a line running
south from Sydney, not along the coast, but following
the river valleys and so up again on to the plateau
at Goulburn. Here we branch off from the main line
southwards through the Monaro Plains; this is a high
pasture land, thinly populated, though there is a growing
agricultural industry in some of the more favoured
spots. To the east of the plain are the Coast Ranges,
to the west the Snowy Mountains; both extending over
the border into Victoria. Cooma, the terminus of the
railway, about fifty miles from the State boundary,
lies nearly three thousand feet above sea-level. North-west
of Cooma is the town of Kiandra, in the Alps,
where we find snow and winter sports as in Switzerland.
South-west of Cooma is Mount Kosciusko, rising
over seven thousand feet, the highest mountain in <span class="linenum">39</span>
Australia; here the snow lies even in summer. We
reach it by a road following the valley of the Snowy <span class="linenum">40</span>
River, and can ride or even motor up the track almost
to the summit. Here are two views of the river and <span class="linenum">41</span>
its tributaries. Kosciusko is not an imposing peak as
we see from these pictures, but merely a flattened ridge <span class="linenum">42</span>
lying on the top of a great tableland, so perhaps we may
be somewhat disappointed in the outcome of our visit. <span class="linenum">43</span></p>

<p>From Goulburn we begin the long descent to the
level of the Murray. We are again crossing the agricultural
belt, and forty miles west of Goulburn we
break our journey at Yass. Here, on the banks of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
small stream, the site has been fixed for the ideal city,
the future capital of Federal Australia. Notice that
we can have here no great industrial and commercial
centre, but merely a town like Bathurst, a centre of
farming and country life. Perhaps in this it will be
more representative of the real Australia than are the
larger cities. In position Yass is nearer Sydney than
Melbourne; but it is roughly halfway between
Brisbane and Adelaide; so that it is fairly central for
the long belt which contains most of the population
of Eastern Australia. The city is not to be allowed <span class="linenum">44</span>
to grow haphazard; here we see the surveyors’ camp
and the surveyors at work, mapping out the ground. <span class="linenum">45</span>
In the distance is Black Mountain. The whole scene
is quiet and rural, but it will be very different in a few <span class="linenum">46</span>
years’ time. This deliberate choosing of a site for a
new city is common in Australian history; we may
contrast with this the way in which centres of population
have grown up in the course of ages in old countries
almost of their own accord.</p>

<p>We continue our journey down the slope, and crossing
the Murrumbidgee at Wagga Wagga reach Albury, the
border town. Here, it is necessary to change trains
to continue the journey to Melbourne, for unfortunately
the different States of Australia did not plan their
railways on the same scale. In New South Wales the
gauge of the lines is the same as that in England; in
Victoria and in part of South Australia there is a
broad gauge; while all the other railways in the
continent are on a narrow gauge of three feet six inches.
This has been adopted as the most economical for
opening up a new country; but the differences have
led to great inconvenience and loss, where through
connexion is made between the main railway systems
of the various States. We may remember how, in our
own country, the Great Western Railway was forced
to abandon the old and comfortable broad gauge, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
as to be able to work in connexion with all the other
lines which had adopted a narrower gauge; Australia
has still to face the problem of unifying her railways in
this respect.</p>

<p>We have travelled for many miles over the railways, <span class="linenum">(13)</span>
and now perhaps we may begin to notice certain
peculiarities in their arrangement. First there is the
main-line system connecting up the capitals. This
runs north-east and south-west from Sydney, roughly
parallel to the coast. Only a short stretch of this is
on the low coastal plain; the rest is inside the plateau
edge. The line descends through the Victorian Mountains
to the sea at Melbourne; but goes inland again
on its way to Adelaide. Branching from this system,
or starting independently from the coast, is a whole
series of lines running inland, roughly at right-angles
to the coast. Some are very short, some very long;
and they commonly end at a small town on one of the
rivers. We can trace them right round from the line
between Normanton and Croydon, in North-West
Queensland, to that ending at Oodnadatta in the desert
region of South Australia. Except round Bathurst,
and in the country at the back of Melbourne, we shall
not find many branches or cross connexions. This
curious arrangement can only be understood in the light
of the resources and historical development of the
country; we have already seen something of its
meaning in New South Wales.</p>

<p>We noticed that the line from Sydney left the sea at
Newcastle to follow the valley of the Hunter and scale
the edge of the Liverpool Downs. For two hundred
miles north of Newcastle the coast district lacks a
railway; but in Clarence county, in the extreme north
of the State, there is a detached piece of line running
for a hundred miles not far from the coast, and touching
it at one or two points. This line has a meaning.</p>

</div>

<p>The district is warm, as it is low-lying, and not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
far from the tropic; while the south-east winds bring
abundant rains. It has been found to be well fitted
for dairy cattle, and is displacing to some extent the
coast district south of Sydney where the industry first
started. Sydney still provides a good local market
for the dairy products of this northern region, but
there is also a growing trade with more distant places.
We can understand now the need of a railway to open
up the country and connect it with the sea.</p>

<p>Here is a typical dairy farm with the cattle clustered <span class="linenum">47</span>
in the shade on the banks of the creek. We notice
the abundance of trees, and the curious dead bare
look of some of them. These have been ringbarked,
that is, a strip of bark has been cut away right round
the trunk; this process kills the tree quickly, and the
dead wood can then be burnt off. It is a rough and
extravagant method of clearing, and some of the
forest, which grows luxuriantly in this rainy district,
is put to better use. In the wetter parts are to be
found the cedar and other soft ornamental woods; in
the drier, are the various hard woods of the eucalyptus
family, especially the ironbark and the blackbutt.
It was the timber which attracted the first <span class="linenum">48</span>
settlers to this district, though the difficulty of transport
has prevented them from making much use of it
up to the present. Here we see the felled timber lying
ready for removal; it must be dragged over rough <span class="linenum">49</span>
tracks, often for long distances, by teams of horses
and bullocks. We can gain some idea, from these
pictures, of the huge size of the trees and the difficulty
of forest development. Evidently the forest further
inland can only be attacked by the aid of the railway.
We shall find similar conditions in Queensland; in
fact, we may look on this coast strip as giving us
geographically the beginning of the Queensland coast
conditions; for round Grafton, at the southern end
of the railway, we find the cultivation of the sugar-cane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>We have seen the beginning of the new capital of
Federated Australia; we will now, before visiting
Queensland, cross Torres Strait, with its innumerable
islands and reefs, for a glimpse of Australia’s new
tropical colony. British New Guinea, or Papua as it is
now officially styled, was annexed in 1888, owing to
pressure from the Australian colonies, and more
particularly Queensland. From the first, Queensland,
New South Wales and Victoria contributed to the cost
of administration; and in 1906 the new Commonwealth
Government took over the entire control.</p>

<p>British Papua is a curiously shaped corner, carved <span class="linenum">50</span>
out of the eastern end of the great island of New
Guinea. The western end of the island is entirely
Dutch; the eastern we share with Germany. We may
think of British Papua as two separate blocks, as the
Gulf of Papua almost divides the territory into two.
In the west is a rectangular area, with a low marshy
coast, fringed with mangroves and split up by river
deltas, especially that of the Fish River. The dividing
line in this district between British and Dutch territory
is merely a line of longitude. The country is
mostly unexplored, except along the Fish and Strickland
Rivers, and the natives are still fighters and cannibals.
On the north of this block of country, and
continuing south-east through a long narrow peninsula,
is a high mountain backbone, on the other side of
which is German territory. The eastern peninsula is
mountainous everywhere; while the whole country is
wet, densely forested and difficult to penetrate. The
peninsula ends in a string of islands, mostly volcanic.</p>

<p>The colony is in the first stage of organisation, when
the main problem is to reduce the native to some kind
of order. Let us see what he is like and how he lives. <span class="linenum">51</span>
Here are two inhabitants of the coast district; they
seem very different from the aborigines of Australia.
Notice their frizzy hair, standing out in a great mop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and their bracelets and necklaces. The Papuans are
fond of personal adornment. Here is a girl from the <span class="linenum">52</span>
same district; she wears an elaborate girdle of grass.
Behind her we see the end of a curious canoe, with
an outrigger. The canoe is important to the Papuan,
since he commonly plants his village at the water’s
edge. Here is a village, and here is a nearer view of <span class="linenum">53</span>
some of the houses; they are merely covered platforms,
built on piles. Fighting and headhunting are <span class="linenum">54</span>
still the amusements of the tribes which are not yet
brought under our control, but conditions are changing
rapidly for the better. Here is one of the instruments <span class="linenum">55</span>
of the change, the native village constable, who seems
quite proud of his office. Behind him, law and order <span class="linenum">56</span>
are represented by the visiting magistrate with a small
force of armed constabulary. The chief difficulty in
opening up the country is that of movement. Everywhere
we find forest, mountain, and unbridged streams. <span class="linenum">57</span>
Here is the kind of track through which the explorer
must force his way, and here we see two methods of <span class="linenum">58</span>
crossing a stream. The native bridge hardly seems
calculated for heavy traffic. We may realise from <span class="linenum">59</span>
these pictures the nature of the task of controlling the
natives of the interior, such as the formidable pair in <span class="linenum">60</span>
front of us. Even when reduced to order the Papuan
is not anxious to develop the country by work on
plantation or mine.</p>

<p>Port Moresby, the capital, stands on a fine bay in
a relatively dry district. Here a few score white
people represent the influence of civilisation. The
climate forbids effective settlement. Here we see a <span class="linenum">61</span>
European house with its staff of servants, and here is
the steamer which links Papua with the mainland. It <span class="linenum">62</span>
will be interesting to see how Australia solves the
various problems of her new tropical Dependency.
In Queensland we shall find similar problems, though in
a modified shape.</p>

<p class="noindent">The land route from New South Wales to Queensland
does not at present follow the sea-coast. The railway
at Newcastle turns up the valley of the Hunter River,
climbs the steep edge of the plateau, to run along the
eastern rim of the Liverpool Plains and the Darling
Downs, and then descends again by a steep pass to the
sea-level at Brisbane. At the little frontier station of
Wallangarra we must change trains, since the Queensland <span class="linenum">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1</span>
railways, as we have already noticed, are on a
narrower gauge than those of New South Wales. This
would be a very serious matter but for the alternative
route by sea to Sydney; this is the natural route for
heavy goods, since nearly all the important towns of
Queensland are on or near the sea-coast. Before the
advent of the railway, the sea was the sole means of
intercourse for all the towns on the eastern rim of
Australia; even in our own country, where the railway
system is highly developed, the coasting trade is still
of very great importance.</p>

<div class="figright">

<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Queensland: Orographical.</span><br />
<em>By permission of the Diagram Co.</em></div>
</div>

<p>The course of the railway suggests that the structure
of the country is not unlike that which we have seen <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 2</span>
in New South Wales. This is true of the Darling
Downs area, but further north the map shows us a somewhat
different type of country. The eastern part of the
State consists in the main of a broken and irregular
highland mass; the west of rolling plains, sloping
gently towards the interior or the Gulf of Carpentaria;
but we look in vain for a long, well-marked escarpment,
such as we find further south. The mountain ridges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
seem to run in every direction, sometimes, as near
Cairns, forming a definite coast-range, at others
striking inland or running down in spurs to the sea;
so that the country
is split up into a
number of distinct
basins, each with its
own group of rivers
flowing in the most
diverse courses.
Thus, from Cairns
to Brisbane a great
stretch of country,
broadest in the
middle, narrow at
both ends, drains
into the Pacific; but
the Burdekin and
the headwaters of
the Fitzroy flow
for long distances
parallel to the coast,
before turning and
breaking through
the ranges to the
sea. Another group
in the south joins the Murray-Darling system and
belongs physically to New South Wales; the rivers
of the north-west and of the Cape York peninsula
drain for the most part into the Gulf of Carpentaria,
while a large block of country in the west and
south-west is occupied by intermittent streams, which
in time of flood find their way into the inland basin
of Lake Eyre, in South Australia. The country has
not that simplicity of relief which we found over the
greater part of New South Wales, and, as we might
expect, the rainfall does not show such clear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
symmetrical divisions. The fall from the south-east
winds is more irregular and more widely distributed <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 3</span>
inland than in New South Wales; while in the north
there is an area
with tropical rains
of a monsoon
type.</p>

<span class="smcap">Queensland: Rainfall.</span></div>
</div>

<p>On our railway
journey we have
crossed from one
State to another,
but we must
notice that, except
in the south-east
corner, the
boundaries of
Queensland have
no relation to the
natural features of
the country; they
are merely mathematical
lines. The
reason for this is
to be found in the
method by which
the settlement was
carried out. Moreton Bay was one of Cook’s landing-places
in 1770; but the Brisbane River, flowing into
it, was not discovered until 1823; the first settlement
was formed in 1824, and the Province remained part
of the mother State until 1859, when after much
agitation it became an independent settlement. The
interior was not explored at the time, so that the only
way of determining a boundary was to follow a line
of latitude or longitude. A similar method has been
used in more recent times in parcelling out unexplored
regions of Africa among the European Powers. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
western boundary of the new State was the line of
longitude 138° E., and what is now the Northern
Territory remained nominally part of New South
Wales, which thus consisted for a short time of two
areas widely separated.</p>

<p>The very name of the city of Brisbane recalls the
connexion with the older colony, since Sir Thomas
Brisbane was Governor of New South Wales in the
years 1821&ndash;5, at the time of the first settlement. The
city stands, not on the shores of Moreton Bay, as we
might expect, but twenty miles up the river, on both <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 4</span>
banks, which are connected by the Victoria bridge.
Here is a view over the bridge from the north bank; <span class="linenum">5,6</span>
and here is a wide view of the river beyond the city.
There is plenty of space in Brisbane, with its suburbs,
for the population of 100,000; there are parks and
gardens everywhere, and a large number of fine public
buildings. Here are the library and the Executive <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 7</span>
Buildings in a beautiful garden, with a statue of Queen
Victoria; here again the Parliament House, and here one <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 8</span>
of the main streets of the city. We have nothing like
this in any town of the same size in England, but we <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 9</span>
must remember that Brisbane has been built for the
future, and is the capital of a State more than three
times the size of France.</p>

<p>Brisbane lies in the extreme corner of Queensland, not,
it may seem, a very good position for the capital; but
the south has the more temperate climate, while
behind Brisbane is some of the most fertile land in the
State. Westward a railway runs for nearly five
hundred miles, at right-angles to the coast-line, to
Charleville on the Warrego; we are about to make a
rapid survey of the country from it. Twenty-five
miles out, we pass through Ipswich, at the head of the
river navigation; it is a busy town with valuable
coal mines and the main railway works of the State.
Then we climb again the steep plateau edge, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
we descended on our journey from Sydney, and come
out at Toowoomba, on the Darling Downs, fifteen
hundred to two thousand feet above the level of the
sea.</p>

<p>The Darling Downs country was reached in 1827,
by Allan Cunningham, botanist and explorer, who
travelled by way of the Hunter River and the
Liverpool Plains; but the journey was difficult, and
the first occupation was not until 1840, when Patrick
Leslie brought over a few sheep and settled in the
neighbourhood of Warwick. Others soon followed;
the direct road to the coast was discovered, and
the basin of the Condamine River became a great
pastoral country where fortunes were made by the
early squatters. There is less rain here than on the
eastern side of the plateau edge, but it is sufficient
for agriculture, and there is plenty of water in the
streams. Much of the soil is volcanic in origin,
and of great fertility, so that the land is wasted on <span class="linenum">10</span>
sheep. Here we see the natural grass in this fertile
region, and here is a great sheep run. The rancher’s <span class="linenum">11</span>
home, which we have next, suggests comfort and
success. At the present time, with the aid of the Government, <span class="linenum">12</span>
the great pastoral properties are being broken
up gradually, and sold or let to farmers; so that a
district which started as a sheep run bids fair to become
one of the most important agricultural areas in Australia.
Toowoomba, the chief centre of this fertile district, has <span class="linenum">13</span>
already the air of a busy and prosperous market town,
as we may judge from the picture here.</p>

<p>As we travel further west the country becomes
drier and rather less fertile, so that agriculture gives
way more and more to sheep. The conditions are not
unlike those which we found to the west of Sydney;
and we have seen that the Condamine and other rivers
of this area all belong to the New South Wales river
system. In fact we are crossing the northern end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the long agricultural belt which lies behind the coast
ranges. Though we are close to the Tropic, the climate
is not very different from that further south, owing to
the height of the plateau above the sea. There are
even slight frosts in the winter. Further north, we
shall find a marked change; wheat disappears and
sheep give way more and more to cattle. The cause
of this lies in the different conditions of rainfall and
temperature. To visit this country to the north we
must return to Brisbane and resume our journey along
the coast.</p>

<p>Our first port of call is Gladstone, nearly three
hundred miles north of Brisbane, on the landlocked
inlet of Port Curtis, one of the finest natural harbours
on the whole coast. Here is a view of the bay and the <span class="linenum">14</span>
jetty. As we see, there is no very great trade at present,
no line of wharves and warehouses; the importance of <span class="linenum">15</span>
Gladstone is in the future; its chief business at present
is the shipment of meat and cattle. A short railway
journey takes us to Rockhampton, which lies some <span class="linenum">16</span>
distance up a river, the Fitzroy; in this it resembles
Brisbane. Near Rockhampton we find a steamer <span class="linenum">17</span>
loading frozen meat from the factory. From Rockhampton
the central railway runs nearly due west for
over four hundred miles, to the Thompson River on
the Bowen Downs. There is also a railway along the <span class="linenum">18</span>
coast to Brisbane, linking up the various small seaports;
but this line is a late construction. The typical
railway of Queensland starts from the coast and runs
directly inland; and the development of the country
follows the same course.</p>

<p>As we follow this inland line, in the wetter districts
near the coast we find cattle everywhere. Further
west, where the rainfall grows less, there are more
sheep; but the area of considerable rainfall is much
greater than in the districts further south, owing to
the broadening out and irregularity of the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
highland mass. The whole of this moist area is particularly
suited to cattle.</p>

<p>Before the settler can begin either cultivating the
soil or raising cattle, there is much preliminary work to
be done. A large part of Eastern Queensland is covered
with forest or scrub, which must be cleared by cutting
down and burning. Here we have a settler starting <span class="linenum">19</span>
operations in a rough camp: he seems to have a difficult
task before him. Here he has reached the stage of a <span class="linenum">20</span>
permanent hut, with a small area of cultivated land
round it, and beyond, roughly fenced pasture with the
remnants of the forest showing in it. Here again are <span class="linenum">21</span>
the cattle feeding in pasture where the trees have been
ringbarked and so partly destroyed. To destroy, cut
down, and burn trees which may yield valuable timber
may seem an extravagant method, but the settler here
has even less choice than in the Grafton district of New
South Wales, where we saw the same methods employed.
The timber is certainly valuable. Here are specimens
of the hardwoods which we use for street pavements
and railway sleepers, and for other purposes where great
strength and endurance are needed; these are the blackbutt <span class="linenum">22</span>
and Queensland Karri pine, and there are many
other varieties. The difficulty is to get them to the
markets where they are wanted. Here we see one
method; a trainload of sleepers is leaving the sawmills, <span class="linenum">23</span>
bound for India; but the railways are few and in many
districts the logs must be dragged at a slow rate by
bullock teams to the banks of the nearest creek, where
they lie perhaps for months until there is enough water
to float them down to the larger rivers and so to a seaport.
This method is commonly used for the cedar
which grows near the coast, and we have already seen
it in New South Wales. Except in a few places easily
accessible, the natural forest wealth of Queensland is
as yet hardly touched.</p>

<p>The railway which we have been following from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Rockhampton runs almost along the Tropic. Townsville,
our next landing-place, over eight hundred miles
north-west of Brisbane, is well within the Tropic, yet
in many ways it resembles Rockhampton and Gladstone.
From this point another long line runs inland
to end on a tributary of the Diamantina, about a
hundred miles north-west of the terminus of the line
from Rockhampton. We may notice that both these
lines, after crossing the wide area of coastal drainage,
reach the streams flowing into the Lake Eyre basin.
They thus form real links with the interior. After
Brisbane, Rockhampton and Townsville are the most <span class="linenum">24</span>
important ports in the State. Townsville lies on a
broad open bay, and the harbour has been made at <span class="linenum">25</span>
great cost by building out long jetties. This has been
done because here is the sole outlet for a very large area
of country to the west. Here we find more meat and <span class="linenum">26</span>
cattle; and again at Bowen, a small port on a fine
natural harbour which we passed further south, they
are landing cattle for the local stockbreeders. In short,
the whole of this north and north-eastern district is <span class="linenum">27</span>
the home of cattle; cattle running on the cleared scrub
lands and pastures of the interior, or fattening on the
rich alluvial lands round the creeks near the coast, <span class="linenum">28</span>
where the surroundings, as we see from this picture, are
very different.</p>

<p>The coast region itself has something of far greater
interest than cattle. There is here a higher uniform
temperature than in the uplands, and in some parts a
very heavy rainfall; the result is the growth of tropical
and sub-tropical plants, and of these plants one of the
most interesting to us is sugar. We find sugar-cultivation
in patches, all along the coast from Brisbane
northwards; and a little even in the extreme north
of New South Wales, since the change in climate is very
gradual in the coast region. But the most important
districts for sugar lie near or inside the Tropic, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the cane is grown on the rich alluvial lands of the
coast plains and river valleys.</p>

<p>On our voyage to Townsville we passed Mackay, one
of the chief centres of sugar-production; outside the
Tropic is Bundaberg, where the cane is grown by the
aid of irrigation; while in the far north is the important
district of Cairns. The fertile land is covered with dense
scrub and must be cleared; here is a clearing in progress; <span class="linenum">29</span>
notice that the scrub is different from that which we saw
up-country: it is palm. Within two years of planting
the shoots the cane is ready for cutting, and in the
northern districts we can go on for many years cutting
the new canes as they spring up, without the need of
re-planting. Here is the cane growing by irrigation in <span class="linenum">30</span>
Bundaberg, one of the drier districts, and here is the
reaping of the harvest. We notice that the cutters are <span class="linenum">31</span>
white men. In the early days of sugar, the cultivation
was on large estates, each manufacturing its sugar in
its own mill. The heavy work was done by Kanakas,
imported from the islands of the neighbouring Pacific.
This is no longer allowed, and the cane is grown more
and more on small farms, by white labour. The
growers then sell it to a central mill, where the cane is
crushed and the juice extracted. Some of the mills
are owned by the small farmers on the co-operative
principle, but more often the miller has nothing to do
with the growing of the crop. Here we see a trainload <span class="linenum">32</span>
of canes bound for the mill. There is now a Government
bounty given for sugar produced entirely by white
labour, and it seems to have been proved that, on the
small farming system, it can be grown thus and show
a good profit. But there are other and more attractive
occupations for white people in Queensland, and
though the whole coast, right round to the Gulf of
Carpentaria, is suitable for sugar, it does not seem
likely in the near future to become a large industry in
a White Australia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Sugar is one of the most interesting and valuable
of the tropical products of the coast region; but
many others are grown, some for the market, others
hardly beyond the experimental stage. Let us look <span class="linenum">33</span>
at some of these. Here at Woombye are pineapples
and bananas growing; and on the Johnstone River <span class="linenum">34</span>
huge crates of bananas are being shipped for the
markets in the towns further south. At Kuranda, on <span class="linenum">35</span>
the Barron River, is a large coffee plantation where
we may see the bushes growing and follow the berry
as it is dried and husked. Here we notice the <span class="linenum">36</span>
pruning of the coffee bush, and here is a fine specimen
with the pruning completed. Not far away, in the <span class="linenum">37</span>
State Nursery at Kamerunga, we find all kinds of
tropical plants growing side by side. The nursery
is an official experiment ground, since the Government
is anxious to test the possibilities of the region for
all kinds of economic plants. We walk down a fine <span class="linenum">38</span>
avenue of palms and visit the quarter where they are
experimenting with rubber trees. Here is a large <span class="linenum">39</span>
plantation of the trees, and here we see the method
of tapping. In a corner we come on a curious African <span class="linenum">40</span>
rubber tree, in which the juice exudes, not from the
bark, but from the fruit. More prosaic, but none the <span class="linenum">41</span>
less useful, are the fibre plants, such as sisal hemp, of
which we have a fine specimen here. Cotton-growing <span class="linenum">42</span>
has also been attempted on a small scale, and the
Commonwealth Government provides a bounty for its
encouragement. The main difficulty is the high cost
of labour for its cultivation. Here we see the picking <span class="linenum">43</span>
of the cotton. We may gain some idea from these
gardens of the great variety of tropical and sub-tropical
plants, all of which will grow well on some part of this
northern coast. The only need is labour to clear the
scrub and make full use of the fertile alluvial soil and
the warm rains.</p>

<p>Clearing is very necessary in this region since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
bush grows with great luxuriance. By travelling
inland a few miles from Cairns we may find a picture <span class="linenum">44</span>
of the bush in its natural state. The coastal plain
south of Cairns is very narrow, for in the background,
a short distance inland, are various mountain ranges
such as the Bellenden Ker range, said to be the highest <span class="linenum">45</span>
in Queensland. Only twenty miles from Cairns, in
the foothills of one of these ranges, the little Barron
River comes tumbling down in rapids and falls, amid <span class="linenum">46</span>
some of the finest scenery in Australia. Here is the
river a short distance above the falls; and here are the <span class="linenum">47</span>
falls themselves from above and below. The railway,
following the course of the river, brings us to the <span class="linenum">48</span>
little township of Atherton. Here is the main street.
We notice here a Chinese joss-house; this may serve <span class="linenum">49</span>
to remind us that there are other immigrants besides
the Kanakas in this northern region of whom account <span class="linenum">50</span>
must be taken by the advocates of a White Australia.
The Chinese have already spread all over the Malay <span class="linenum">51</span>
region to the north, and might equally occupy tropical
Australia if special measures were not adopted to
check their immigration.</p>

<p>In the country round Atherton we have all kinds
of typical bush scenery. At one spot we pass giant
fig-trees overhanging the road; next we enter the <span class="linenum">52</span>
denser bush. We find lakes in the bush, of which the
chief is Lake Eachem, which we have seen before.
Everything suggests warmth and moisture. The rivers,
lakes, and natural vegetation of this region, together
with the fertile soil in the low-lying strip between the
mountains and the sea, give us a picture of the conditions
which prevail along the greater part of the
Queensland coast. Here is a tropical garden, typical <span class="linenum">53</span>
of the coast. Similar conditions extend right across
the northern edge of the Australian continent.</p>

<p>We have seen that the coast strip at Cairns is very
narrow: behind the mountain edge we shall find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
rivers flowing west into the Gulf of Carpentaria. As
we travel westward we enter rather a different type of
country. There is less rain than on the coast, but
more than in the interior further south. We must
remember that in this part of Queensland we are getting
near the zone where a heavy monsoon rain sweeps in
from the Pacific in summer. All this country is well
fitted for cattle; but it is as yet thinly peopled, since
there are few railways, so that it lacks an outlet to
the sea. The existing railways are intended to serve
the mining districts, since the gold of this region has
been the chief attraction up to the present time.
There are goldfields scattered all along the eastern
side of the highlands. On the Cooktown line is Palmerville;
on the Townsville line are Charters Towers and
the Cape River field; near Rockhampton is Mount <span class="linenum">54</span>
Morgan, one of the most famous mines in the past;
it has given rise to a large town which we see here.
Here, too, we see the crushing of the ore, preliminary <span class="linenum">55</span>
to the chemical extraction of the gold. Near the
coast, north of Brisbane, is the Gympie field, and
in the far north, near the Gulf of Carpentaria, is
Croydon. There are many smaller fields, and we can
easily see the connexion between the railways and
the gold. There are other minerals, too, in this area, <span class="linenum">56</span>
so we see a whole township based on tin, and another
growing up round a copper mine. <span class="linenum">57</span></p>

<p>Some of the railways have done more than develop
the mining areas; they have been pushed westward
into the pastoral country on the long inland slopes of
Queensland. We have already followed the southern
lines for some distance, and we must now carry
our exploration beyond the railway zone, for a very
large area in the State is as yet quite untouched by
railways. This area will be greatly reduced by the
execution of the scheme contemplated by the State
Government for linking up all the railways both along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the coast and inland. First there is the country in
the basin of the Flinders River, round the southern end
of the Gulf of Carpentaria; this is being opened up
slowly from the sea. It contains much good pasture land,
and already feeds a large number of cattle. Further
south is the drier country where the streams drain
towards the Lake Eyre basin; this is part of the Rolling
Plains which occupy West and South-West Queensland
and the north-west corner of New South Wales. This
area is most interesting owing to the possibility of
obtaining water from beneath the ground.</p>

<p>The rainfall is somewhat scanty, and in the dry
weather the creeks lose themselves in the desert sands or
become mere strings of waterholes. There may be enough
food for the cattle or sheep, but they must have water
also, and this can only be found underground. In the
higher country to the east, where the rains are relatively
heavy, are large areas where the water sinks readily
into the ground, as the rock is porous. A long way
below the surface it is held up by impervious strata
of clay or rock and begins to creep away downhill
towards the west and the Gulf of Carpentaria. To the
west the surface also becomes impermeable, so that
the water is confined between the two layers, and
can be reached anywhere by boring through the top
covering. Sometimes in these boreholes the water
does not rise as far as the surface of the ground, and <span class="linenum">58</span>
so must be pumped up; but more often it spouts
out with great force, as we see it here. Some of these
artesian wells give over a million gallons a day, and
penetrate for three or four thousand feet into the
earth. The water is often warm and charged with
salts; but this does not seem to harm the cattle. The
water from the bore is run off into trenches extending
perhaps for miles, so that there is plenty of room for
the cattle to drink. By the aid of these wells cattle can
live in the country all the year round; and even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
desert stock-route from South Australia to Queensland
can be kept open in the dry season. The utilisation
of a simple geological fact is changing the whole face
of the country.</p>

<p>We have already seen that most of the chief towns
of Queensland lie on or near the coast, and that there
are many harbours, often protected by islands. The
towns are there because the country was developed
for the most part from the sea, and in fact settlement
inland is still confined to the neighbourhood of the
railways running up-country from these coast towns.
The harbours are there because the land has sunk and
the coast is partly drowned, giving deep sea-inlets,
often where the sea has flooded some old river valley.
As the coast gradually sank, the coral builders were at
work, piling up their reefs in the warm shallows. So
we get the Great Barrier Reef, stretching for fifteen <span class="linenum">59</span>
hundred miles along the coast and leaving a calm
though rather dangerous channel between itself and
the mainland. The reef is really a series of reefs,
resting on a platform of older rock, and pierced with
numerous openings, especially where the larger rivers
enter the sea; for the coral will not grow in fresh
water. In the neighbourhood of this reef, especially in
the north, towards Thursday Island, fishing for pearl
oysters is largely carried on. The oysters are valuable
for the mother of pearl, rather than for the pearls
themselves, which are very small. Here, too, is found <span class="linenum">60</span>
in great quantity the trepang, or sea slug as it is sometimes
called, looking like millions of brown cucumbers <span class="linenum">61</span>
crawling over the reef. Here is a portrait of one
kind of the trepang; it does not seem very appetising,
but the Chinese consider it a great delicacy. Nearly
the whole of the trepang gathered in this region is
exported to China, after being first cooked and dried.
The rest is eaten by the natives, as it does not appeal
to European tastes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>In New South Wales we did not encounter the
aboriginal Australian, since there he has practically
disappeared. But he still survives in considerable
numbers in parts of Queensland, where the country is
less favourable for white occupation or has been
settled for a shorter period. Government at the
present day protects the aborigines as far as possible;
but none the less they are steadily dying out and do
not count in the future development of the country.
We have already seen how, for the hard work of the
plantations, the brown men from the islands of the
Pacific were brought in, as there was no native labour
available. The Kanaka has now been rejected, and
Australia steadily refuses to admit the Chinese, who
seem to be able to adapt themselves to any country
and any climate. So the future of this northern part
of the continent depends largely on the extent to which
the natural resources of the country, as distinct from
its minerals, can be exploited by purely white labour.
Some parts of the coastlands are clearly not fitted for
European occupation, and the policy of a White Australia
is only rendered possible by the fact that the
elevation of much of the country within the Tropic
greatly modifies the climatic conditions. If Northern
Australia had been a great lowland, its history must
have been far different.</p>

<span class="fs80">VICTORIA AND TASMANIA</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Following the example of the original settlers, we will
approach Melbourne from the sea, as in this way we <span class="linenum">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1</span>
shall perhaps get the clearest view of the peculiarities
of the State of Victoria. From Sydney to Cape Howe,
we are still following the coastal plain of New South
Wales, with the plateau edge in the background. But
when we round Cape Howe and turn westward the
coast changes: a series of mountain ridges runs down
to the sea, ending in promontories with fiord-like inlets
between them. The eastern end of Victoria is occupied
by an irregular mountain mass, trending on the whole
north and south. West of the mouth of the Snowy
River, the coast scenery changes again, and we have
Ninety Mile Beach. Here long banks of sand, brought
by the strong currents from the west, have silted up
the mouth of an old river valley. The water is thus
held up and spreads out into lagoons, which communicate <span class="linenum">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2</span>
with the sea here and there through narrow
channels. Further west still are isolated mountain
ranges, one of which ends at Wilson Promontory, the
southernmost point of the mainland of Australia.
In the bight between this promontory and Cape Otway,
lie Western Port and Port Phillip, wide bays with
narrow entrances. Beyond Port Phillip the coast is
fringed by the Otway ranges; and then follows a low
plain, with few inlets or good harbours, a region of
lakes and swamps. So we see three great irregular
curves or bights, with great variety of coast-line;
Port Phillip lies at the top of the middle curve. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> <span class="linenum">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3</span>
is a drowned valley, like the lagoons further east,
and is almost blocked at the mouth by the drifting
sands. It is the only good natural harbour on this
part of the coast, and is still the centre of settlement
and of the area of densest population.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i068.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Port Phillip.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Though the harbour of Port Phillip was discovered
at the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was over
thirty years before a permanent settlement was planted
on its shores. Something was learnt of the country in
1824, when Hume and Hovell, travelling overland from
New South Wales along the route now partly followed
by the railway, reached the spot where Geelong now
stands. The coast at that time was unoccupied, except
for a few whalers who were settled at Portland in the
far west. The real occupation of Victoria was brought
about by the fusion of two distinct streams of immigrants,
one coming by land, the other by sea. In 1836
Sir Thomas Mitchell, one of the greatest of the New
South Wales explorers, came over from the Murray
basin and discovered the fertile plains at the back of
Port Phillip; Australia Felix he named this country of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
promise. His report on the country led to a rapid
movement from New South Wales over the border
southward. But the journey from Sydney by land
was long and arduous, and the southern part of Victoria,
like the coast region of New South Wales, was most
easily and naturally settled from the sea.</p>

<p>In 1835 a Tasmanian, John Batman, representing a
syndicate of Tasmanians, surveyed the site of Melbourne
and tried to buy it from the natives; but the
New South Wales Government refused to sanction the
arrangement. Still other Tasmanians followed, and a
body led by Fawkner actually settled on the Yarra
in 1835. The two parties naturally quarrelled and the
matter was complicated by the fact that New South
Wales claimed the whole territory. The British Government
supported this claim, and, as a result, in spite of
the difficulty of communication, the people of Melbourne
had to send their parliamentary representative
to Sydney for some years. At length, in 1851, the Port
Phillip district became independent and was re-named
Victoria. The name of the State and its capital easily
remind us of its history; for the official founding of
Melbourne was in 1837, when Queen Victoria came to
the throne and Lord Melbourne was Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Melbourne and Port Phillip have not the picturesque
appearance of Port Jackson and Sydney; the broad,
lagoon-like harbour does not lend itself to scenic effects,
and we have not the deep-water inlets penetrating the
heart of the city which add so much to the beauty and
utility of Sydney. Melbourne is built on the level, with
broad, straight streets and fine buildings, modern and
handsome, a typical Australian city. Here are Collins <span class="linenum">4,5</span>
Street and Bourke Street. Here again are some of the
Government offices; the statue in the foreground is <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 6</span>
one of General Gordon.</p>

<p>Melbourne is a true city of the plains; we have
already noticed that Port Phillip itself is merely part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of a drowned plain. On either side of Melbourne,
between the mountains on the north, which form a
continuous wall from east to west of the State, and the
broken ranges of the coast lies a great lowland, a series
of plains dotted with marshes and detached hills. This
is the Great Valley of Victoria. In the west it is largely
covered with lavas, poured out from volcanoes now
extinct. We can trace many of the old craters,
especially in the district round Ballarat. Here is one <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 7</span>
of them from the inside; notice the shape of the rocks.
It is the lava and the river alluvium which have made
the Great Valley the most fertile area of the whole
State. Eastward the plain narrows for a space and
then broadens out again in the valley of the Latrobe,
behind the lagoons and the Ninety Mile Beach. The
early settlers were quick to notice the fine grasses on
these open plains; they started with sheep, but with
the growth of communications dairy farming and butter
making have increased greatly. Here we have a
typical view on the plains, not far from the great Lake <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 8</span>
Korangamite. It is open rolling country, and the
building in the foreground is a large dairy. We
may see the butter being brought in from a branch
factory to the central collecting station, and can watch
the latest methods of working it by machinery. We
shall find the same scenery and the same industry all
over this area.</p>

<p>Here is another typical scene: a string of draught <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 9</span>
horses is being brought in for sale, and we can follow
them back to their feeding ground on the rich grass of <span class="linenum">10</span>
the open country. Victoria, with a much smaller area,
values her horses at about four-fifths of the total value
of those of New South Wales. They are not raised
only for farm purposes as the picture before us proves.
It is a race meeting, and we might imagine ourselves <span class="linenum">11</span>
in England but for the strange shape of some of the
carriages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>We have had a glimpse of one aspect of Victoria;
the port, the city, and the plain. Now let us turn to
the mountains. We have seen that the east end of the <span class="linenum">12</span>
State is almost filled up by a mass of highland, and we
may notice that the railways only touch the outer
fringe of this district. It is out of the world and thinly
peopled, though much of it is well fitted for cattle.
Westward the highland becomes narrower and sends
out spurs on either side, leaving the Great Valley on
the south, and on the north and north-west a broad
plain sloping down to the Murray River. This corresponds
somewhat to the slope west of the Divide in
New South Wales, but the climate, as we shall see, is
not the same.</p>

<p>As we leave Melbourne and follow the Yarra up-stream <span class="linenum">13</span>
we soon notice a change of scenery. At Warburton,
the rail head, we are well within the highlands.
The river runs through forests of eucalyptus and fern,
and we notice rapids below the primitive bridge. It <span class="linenum">14</span>
is evidently a mountain stream. This district is one
of the playgrounds of Melbourne, and we stumble on <span class="linenum">15</span>
the Christmas camp of the Boy Scouts, who are known
in Australia as well as in our own part of the Empire. <span class="linenum">16</span>
A few miles away to the north is Healesville. We
notice here, as we drive through, that there are some <span class="linenum">17</span>
trees which seem to have shed their leaves. Perhaps
these are some English trees of which many have
been imported, and they find the weather too dry and
hot; for close by we find the native forest with trees
in full leaf. In spite of the presence of English trees,
we may easily recognise the country as Australia by
the great gum trees, with their bare trunks, and
the thorny acacia growing below. The gums and the <span class="linenum">18</span>
tree ferns are everywhere on the hillsides. Even the
house and garden, which we see here, have a slightly <span class="linenum">19</span>
foreign look, and do not seem adapted for the conditions
of an English winter. In fact, there is no winter, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
we understand it, in this part of Victoria, though snow
may lie for months on the heights of the Alps to the
north-east. We must remember that Melbourne lies
in nearly the same latitude as Seville. In the hills to
the north of Melbourne we find the same scenery, with
its abundance of streams and trees. Here is a woodland
scene not far from Mount Macedon in this district, <span class="linenum">20</span>
where the Governor of Victoria has his summer home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us now travel westward by the railway to
Ballarat, which lies on the south face of the narrow
ridge which forms the water-parting between the
Victorian Valley and the north-western plains. Ballarat
is a fine town, second only to Melbourne, and planted
in far more picturesque surroundings. Here is Sturt <span class="linenum">21</span>
Street, named after one of Australia’s greatest explorers;
looking down it we can just see Mount Warrenheit in <span class="linenum">22</span>
the distance. We can wander in the Botanical Gardens
where the aloe is in flower, or stroll by the lake and <span class="linenum">23</span>
admire the black swans. But we have not come here
only for the scenery. Ballarat represents the second
great factor in the development of Victoria: gold.</p>

<p>Within ten years of 1851, when gold was discovered
here in paying quantities, all the chief fields of Victoria
were opened up, and there was a sudden rush of settlers
to the country. Many of the goldfields are so near
Melbourne that it may be considered as a centre of
mining as well as of pastoral industries. Thus we may
account for the fact that it has to-day concentrated
in its neighbourhood nearly half of the total population
of the State. The gold most easily reached was in
the underground leads, the channels of old streams, or
fissures in the rock. In these were found nuggets and
gold dust. Here we see the primitive methods of mining.
A group of miners is sinking a simple shaft and raising <span class="linenum">24</span>
the soil in buckets, while another washes it in a pan to
separate the heavier gold dust. The pick and shovel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> <span class="linenum">25</span>
and the strong arm of the miner are the chief instruments
needed for this form of mining; and the fact
that the goldfields are in the midst of fertile country,
with farms all around them, makes the life much less
hard than in some of the fields of the far interior of
Australia which we shall visit later.</p>

<p>The modern method of mining is to attack the
quartz rock by the aid of machinery; and the shafts
are often carried to a great depth. Here, instead of
the tents of the miners, we see what might be the top <span class="linenum">26</span>
of a coal mine, with elaborate machinery for winding.
We shall examine this type of mine elsewhere; for
though gold has made Victoria in the past, it is not
now the chief gold-producing State in the Commonwealth.
So we pass on, after a glance at a quartz reef <span class="linenum">27</span>
cropping out from the ground&mdash;a sign that has often
guided the prospector in his search.</p>

<p>We have seen that as we travel eastward along the
ridge on which we are standing, the forest grows more
dense and settlement thinner, while roads and railways
disappear. But the greatest change is found as we
travel north and north-west from Ballarat. We have
crossed to the inner slope of the highlands and are
entering a very dry country. In the districts which
we have visited the rainfall is not unlike that of the <span class="linenum">28</span>
Midlands of England, though most comes in the
winter time from the westerly winds. The extreme
east of the State has also, like Sydney, a good deal
of rain in summer from the Pacific. But the great
plain sloping to the Murray is cut off by the highlands
from the moist winds of the oceans and exposed to dry
hot winds sweeping down from the deserts of the
interior. The rivers end in shallow lakes and marshes
on the arid plain; and we may notice that the railways
push out into this district and stop in similar fashion.
It is a region of sandhills, heaths, and a dense scrub,
called <em>mallee</em>; dreary and desolate at first sight, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
not altogether without promise. The soil is very
fertile, being composed of the old river silts, and with
light rains at the right season, or by the aid of irrigation,
it will grow fine crops. Here we see the beginning
of the process of cultivation, by the rolling down of <span class="linenum">29</span>
the <em>mallee</em> scrub.</p>

<p>With large areas of fertile land lying waste for want
of water, and water in abundance in the rivers, we
should expect that attempts would be made to bring
the two together. In New South Wales, near Yass on
the Murrumbidgee, a great scheme is in progress. The
Barren Jack dam, when finished next year, will hold
up and make available for agriculture, a mass of water
comparable to that of the Nile at Assuan. It will preserve,
for the dry season, the water from the winter rains
and the melting snows of spring. Other schemes are
proposed for the Lachlan and Murray; up to the present,
however, the chief development of irrigation has been in
Victoria, on the streams flowing into the Murray and
on the main river itself. Here we see the process of
impounding the water; notice the woods in the background <span class="linenum">30</span>
which show that we are on the upper course
of the stream, near the hills and the region of heavier
rainfall. Here again is a great reservoir being excavated, <span class="linenum">31</span>
to hold the flood water; and next we may
see the water flowing out into the irrigation channel. <span class="linenum">32</span>
In another place the water is being pumped up into
high-level tanks for distribution. The river has <span class="linenum">33</span>
gradually built up a flood plain at a higher level
than its usual channel; so that the water must be
raised before it will flow over the fields. At Mildura
and Renmark, the latter in South Australia, a large
fruit-growing industry has been developed on the basis
of irrigation. So we find lemons and apricots, and
above all the currant and the vine which give us our
dried currants and raisins.</p>

<p>But the supply of water in the rivers is limited, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the rivers are not broad or deep, in spite of their great
length. One of the chief difficulties of all irrigation
schemes is to avoid damage to the interests of people
living lower down the stream, or interference with the
navigation. In this matter the interests of all three
States of the Commonwealth must be considered, since
the Murray basin is divided among them. As we have
already noticed in the case of Queensland and New
South Wales, the State boundaries only coincide in
part with natural features of the country.</p>

<p>The whole character of the river basin depends on
the distribution of the rainfall. In the case of all three
States there is a similar arrangement: first the coast
belt, which is more varied and irregular in Queensland
and Victoria than in New South Wales; then the highland
edge, and then the back slope with a zone of
moderate rainfall which shades off gradually into desert
conditions. This zone narrows as we come southwards
until it almost disappears in South Australia. But
before following it out into this last State we will cross
Bass Strait to visit Tasmania. Victoria, though a
mere corner of the Australian continent, is about the
size of Great Britain, while Tasmania is not very much
smaller than Ireland, and both could support a very
dense population. We must bear these facts in mind
during our rapid journey through the country, since the
maps in our atlases, for the most part, give us utterly
wrong impressions as to the area of Australia.</p>

<p>If we look at a chart showing the depths of the sea, <span class="linenum">34</span>
we may notice that Bass Strait is shallow while the
surrounding seas are deep. From Wilson Promontory
we can trace a connexion through Flinders and Cape
Barren Islands, to the north-east horn of the curved
coast of Tasmania. A similar bridge runs through
from the north-west horn, through the Hunter Islands
and King Island. We may be reminded of the shallows
of the English Channel and the North Sea, and can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
easily imagine that Tasmania, like England, at some
very remote period formed part of the neighbouring
continental mainland. We find, moreover, a general
similarity between the plants and animals on the
opposite sides of the Strait; but there are also some
marked differences which suggest that Tasmania was
separated very long ago and so has had a peculiar and
isolated development.</p>

<p>We cross Bass Strait and steam up the winding
estuary of the Tamar to Launceston. The names <span class="linenum">35</span>
remind us of England, and round us are the counties of
Devon, Dorset, and Cornwall; but we must not be too
ready to take the names as a guide to the character of
the country or the climate. Our vessel lands us at a
busy wharf in the middle of the town, for Launceston,
though second to Hobart in size, is the chief commercial
centre for the island. Here is a general view <span class="linenum">36</span>
of the town: it is modern and well planned and has
fine houses and gardens in the suburbs, like the other
Australian capitals.</p>

<p>A glance at the country round soon shows us
why the early settlers were reminded of the south-west <span class="linenum">37</span>
corner of England. At King’s Bridge we can
leave the broad estuary of the Tamar and turn up
the narrow valley of the Esk. Notice the fishermen:
the streams here abound with fish, mostly introduced
from England. The Esk here flows through a rocky <span class="linenum">38</span>
and wooded gorge; and we might easily imagine
ourselves in Devon or Cornwall. Higher up the scenery
is spoilt by an ugly building with great pipes; it is the <span class="linenum">39</span>
power station for the electric light of the town. The
water power is too valuable to waste, so the picturesque
has been sacrificed to the practical needs of the people.</p>

</div>

<p>As we leave Launceston and travel up the valley of
the Tamar, through beautiful open country, it is still
easy to imagine that we are somewhere in the south of
England. The apple orchards are everywhere. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> <span class="linenum">40</span>
is one on a hill slope, but we notice that it is quite unlike
the grass-grown orchards so common in Devon. The
trees are grown as low bushes, in straight rows; it is
less picturesque but more profitable. They produce
the fine even fruit which we can buy in the London
market. The climate is cooler and moister here than
on the mainland and so is well fitted for most of our
English fruits. There are the same orchards and the
same English crops all along the line of the railway
southward to Hobart. The line follows a narrow
sheltered lowland. On the east is a broken mountainous
country; on the west a great solid plateau, <span class="linenum">41</span>
rising up in tiers or steps, and occupying all the centre
of the island. We shall not cross this central block,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
since it is without road or rail and almost without inhabitants,
a bleak bare roof to the island, feeding a
few sheep in summer, but even then subject to biting
storms and snow.</p>

<p>From Launceston a short journey by rail will take <span class="linenum">42</span>
us to Scottsdale among the hills in the north-eastern
corner of the island. Here we meet the bullock team <span class="linenum">43</span>
hauling timber, and droves of sheep on the road, while
the eucalyptus forest is all around us; on this drier <span class="linenum">44</span>
eastern side of Tasmania we seem to be back again in
Australia. But if we travel westward from Launceston
we shall notice a great change. At first our way lies
over the plains, between the northern edge of the
plateau and the sea. Then, at Burnie, we leave the
sea and strike southwards towards a new country. We
have turned the north-west corner of the plateau, and
between its steep western edge and the sea we find
the plain broken by a detached range of mountains
rising from the level. Here is the chief mining district
in the island.</p>

<p>Let us use our eyes as the train runs swiftly through
this country. The gaunt gum-trees have disappeared;
everywhere are dense forests of the evergreen beech, <span class="linenum">45</span>
called myrtle by the settlers, with its small feathery
leaves. Mingled with the beech are clumps of pine, of
various kinds; and below is a dense undergrowth of
scrub which makes it difficult to penetrate the forest.
The rivers have cut deep gorges in the surface of the
plateau: here we see one of these with its slopes clad <span class="linenum">46</span>
thickly with trees. It is a rugged country, largely unexplored,
and would have few inhabitants but for the
mines. It lies in the track of the strong west winds,
the Roaring Forties, and has a rainfall three times as
heavy as that of the sheltered eastern valleys, a rainfall
only to be compared to that of the wettest parts of the
West of Scotland and Ireland. The vegetation is
naturally different from that of the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
regions of Australia, with their moderate rainfall and
greater warmth; in fact, to find a parallel to Western
Tasmania we must look to New Zealand and to parts
of South America.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The railway on which we are travelling has been
built solely for the benefit of the mines, and we are
drawing near to Zeehan, an important centre for the <span class="linenum">47</span>
production of silver, lead, and other metals. Notice
the mountains in the distance rising up sharply from
the level of the plains. The town looks primitive and <span class="linenum">48</span>
unfinished; little better than a mining camp. Here is
one of the smelteries at the foot of the hills. A little <span class="linenum">49</span>
further on we come down to the sea again at Strahan,
the only seaport of importance on the west coast. It <span class="linenum">50</span>
lies on a fine bay in the deep and almost landlocked
inlet of Macquarie Harbour. This splendid sheet of
water was discovered as early as 1816, but it was too
far away from the settled portion of Tasmania, and it
owes its present importance solely to the presence of
the mines in the country behind it.</p>

<p>A short distance inland is Queenstown, where much <span class="linenum">51</span>
smelting is going on. Notice the desolate appearance
of the country round, and the stumps of the trees which
have been cut down for fuel. Gormanston, with its <span class="linenum">52</span>
background of rugged mountain, is equally desolate.
Close to this town are the famous Mount Lyell copper <span class="linenum">53</span>
mines. Here is the “open cut” where they are quarrying
into the mountain-side, and here are some of the <span class="linenum">54</span>
smelting works. Here again is a general view from
our hotel: the whole country is grim, scarred, and waste, <span class="linenum">55</span>
in great contrast to the beautiful forest scenery a few
miles away. But it is the source of great wealth to
Tasmania.</p>

<p>We shall not attempt to travel further south than
Macquarie Harbour, as there is little beyond but wild
forest and hill country, backed by the bare plateau and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
full in the path of the westerly gales from the Southern
Ocean. It is without roads or railways and has scarcely
a human settlement. So we return to Launceston and
follow the railway southward to Hobart. The coast
of the south-east corner is very different from that of
the rest of the island. It is a drowned coast, with
deep fiords, many islands, and irregular peninsulas
barely connected by narrow necks with the mainland.
On one of these deep fiords stands Hobart, the second
oldest city in the whole of Australasia.</p>

<p>Here we have a general view of Hobart, looking <span class="linenum">56</span>
across the water to the hills beyond. Once again
we are reminded of portions of the Clyde, and only
Sydney can compare with Hobart for the beauty of its
position. Here is another view from the water, with <span class="linenum">57</span>
Mount Wellington in the background rising into the
clouds. In the neighbouring lowlands, sheltered from
the west by the mountains, are more apple orchards;
and in a gully near the town we find a mass of tree <span class="linenum">58</span>
ferns. Here again is Government House, since Hobart
is the political capital of Tasmania: notice the lake <span class="linenum">59</span>
and the trees. Everything around us suggests a mild
and not very dry climate.</p>

<p>If we climb Mount Wellington, the aspect of the <span class="linenum">60</span>
country soon changes. The mountain is not an isolated
peak, but merely the south-eastern corner of the central
plateau. From the summit is a fine view of the fertile
lowland valley and the great expanse of fiords and
islands. But the summit itself is a wild confusion of
boulders with low scrub and heath. This is a very
good guide to the nature of the whole surface of the
plateau behind, and we realise that it is not a favourable
country for the settler, though in some of its wilder
aspects it may attract the tourist. We shall not
attempt to reach the lakes lying on the surface of the
plateau, but content ourselves with a short journey
round its southern rim.</p>

<p>The coach will take us through more orchards, <span class="linenum">61</span>
towards Franklin on the Huon River, where we touch
the eastern side of the broken country from which we
turned back at Macquarie Harbour. There are settlements
all along the Huon Estuary, which runs into the
channel of D’Entrecasteaux. Here we have come
upon an important remnant of past history. The
name is that of a French admiral who was sent out in
1791 to seek for a port in Southern Australia, so that
France might gain a footing in these new islands.
D’Entrecasteaux actually surveyed the Derwent River,
and a later French expedition spent some time in the
neighbourhood. Partly through fear of the designs of
France we occupied Risdon in 1803, and in the following
year, Colonel Collins, not content with the site at Port
Phillip in Victoria, which he had occupied for a short
time, came over and moved the settlement from Risdon
to Hobart. The evidence of the activity of the French
explorers in this region is still to be seen in the names
of capes and bays all along the eastern coast of
Tasmania.</p>

<p>There are saw-mills at Hobart, and all around the
Huon is a fine timber country, easily reached from the
sea. Here we see the beginning of the end: the cutters <span class="linenum">62</span>
have built a rough platform above the undergrowth
and up to the point where the trunk of the tree rises
straight and even. They are using the saw, though
sometimes the whole work is done with the axe. They
are fond of the axe in this part of the world, and it
enters even into their sports, since the chopping match
is a favourite form of athletic contest among them.</p>

<p>The trees in this district grow to a great size; here
we have a forest scene, with the huge logs scattered on <span class="linenum">63</span>
the ground, or loaded on to trucks which will carry
them to the mill. Geeveston is noted for its saw-mills,
one of which we have before us. The logs disappear <span class="linenum">64</span>
inside the mill, and we meet them again as sawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
timber on the little wharf, ready to be shipped to all <span class="linenum">65</span>
parts of the world.</p>

<p>In the valley of the Huon, as well as in that of the
Derwent, are orchards everywhere, proving that we
are still in the sheltered lowland which we have traced
from Launceston southwards. The cottages and gardens,
with their masses of English flowers; the English
trees, oaks and elms, and the hawthorn hedges all along
the roadside, remind us strongly of England. Many
even of the birds are English. In fact, this part of the
island has been quite transformed by the colonists
until it closely resembles the mother country. But
we enter the forest and step at once from England to
Australia. Here are the tall gums with their untidy
bark and dead branches, and the swarms of honey-eating
birds flitting among their blossoms. Here, too,
are the wattle and banksia and many other plants
peculiar to Australia, and the further we move from
civilisation the less there is in the face of the country
to remind us of England. But one difference may be
noted between Tasmania and the rest of Australia:
however far we penetrate into the wild interior we shall
not meet the aborigines. They were few in number at
the time of the first settlement, and the last survivor
died many years ago.</p>

<span class="fs80">SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">On our visits to other great capitals we have found
steamers unloading their cargoes in the very heart of
the city; but Adelaide, founded in 1836 and named
after the wife of King William IV., is neither on the
sea nor on a navigable river. The original settlers
were aiming at a purely agricultural colony, and so
chose a position a few miles inland in the midst of
fertile land and pleasant scenery. So we must land at
Port Adelaide and take the train.</p>

<p>Partly owing to the separation of the port from the <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 1</span>
city, partly owing to the slower and more even growth
of South Australia, Adelaide seems quieter and less
crowded than Melbourne or Sydney, and its inhabitants
consider it to be the model capital of Eastern Australia.
King William Street, which we see here, with the <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 2</span>
statue of Colonel Light, the founder of the city, in the
foreground, does not look in the least commercial. We
get the same impression as we walk along the tree-clad <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 3</span>
banks of the little Torrens River, or cross it by the
City Bridge. We miss the wharves and warehouses <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 4</span>
and steam cranes, and might almost imagine that we
were on a backwater of the Upper Thames. The main <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 5</span>
streets, too, of the city remind us rather of the West
End than of the City of London; while even the post-office <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 6</span>
stands in an open space with trees. In fact, the
whole city, with its wide streets, its parks and gardens, <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 7</span>
gives the impression of spaciousness. If we make our
way, however, to the railway station we shall see that
Adelaide is not by any means without trade. Here are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
collected the products of all the country round; but
as this is purely agricultural, and Adelaide is not the
only outlet, there is not the rush of business which we
saw at Melbourne.</p>

<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">South Australia: Orographical.</span><br />
<em>By permission of the Diagram Co.</em></div>
</div>

<p>Here is a general view which will give us some idea <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 8</span>
of the position of the city. It lies on a plain; a few
miles away to the east the view is shut in by a long, low
ridge. If we climb this ridge and look back towards
the city, we have in sight a large part of the original
South Australia.</p>

<p>South Australia of to-day is a somewhat difficult <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 9</span>
country to analyse; but the ridge on which we are
standing may give us the key to the whole. If we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
follow the heights northwards, we shall find that they
disappear, hundreds of miles away, in the country
south-east of Lake Eyre. South of Adelaide they
curve round and end in Kangaroo Island, which stretches
across the mouth of the Gulf of St. Vincent. These
heights are really the edge of a plateau, and the plateau
slopes gently away from the sea towards the basin of
the Murray. The Murray, at the great bend, turns
sharply southwards and reaches its outlet in Lake
Alexandrina just beyond the southern end of the
highlands.</p>

<p>Between the plateau edge and the sea, Adelaide and
the Gulf towns lie along a narrow strip of lowland.
The Gulf of St. Vincent is merely part of a larger gulf
which is interrupted by Yorke Peninsula, so that we
have really one great inlet running up to Port Augusta
at the head of Spencer Gulf. The west side of this
gulf is formed by another plateau which slopes away
from the sea towards the salt lakes and marshes of the
interior. We thus have two plateaus and a lowland
in between, partly flooded by the sea. A portion of
the surface has dropped down between two lines of
cracks or faults, and a rift valley has been formed.
Lake Torrens occupies the northern end of this valley.
It is the eastern side of the valley, together with a small
part of the back of the plateau, which constitutes the
real South Australia. We may notice that the local
railways are almost confined to this area.</p>

<p>There is, however, one important piece of the State
outside this area. South of Lake Alexandrina we see
a long curving coast, bounded by sandbanks enclosing
a string of lagoons, the Coorong; behind it is the scrub
country which we have met already in the north-west
district of Victoria. Beyond this, in the south-east
corner, especially around Mount Gambier, we find the
same conditions as on the neighbouring coast regions
of Victoria. There is considerable rainfall and there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> <span class="linenum">10</span>
even fresh-water lakes, as we see here. The soil, too, is
fertile, since Mount Gambier belongs to the volcanic
area of Victoria; so that there is agriculture and dairy
farming, and oats are grown. But the district is cut
off from Adelaide by land and has rather a detached
existence, though the railways now being built or
planned will alter this.</p>

<p>We will now explore the country round Adelaide.
In the Mount Lofty ranges, east of the city, there are <span class="linenum">11</span>
streams and waterfalls; but the rivers of the plain are
very small and do not suggest a very heavy rainfall.
Everywhere are orchards and vineyards growing fruits
which are not grown in the open air in England. Here <span class="linenum">12</span>
is an orchard quite near the city, and here is an orange
tree laden with ripening fruit. The rainfall is very <span class="linenum">13</span>
light and comes mostly in the winter, while the summers
are hotter than in most of the occupied regions of
Australia. We have the sunny climate of the Mediterranean
and a corresponding vegetation. Yet it is
healthy for white people, in spite of the heat, owing to
the dry clear air; while the highlands only a few miles
away offer a refuge in the summer.</p>

<p>On the eastward side of the plateau there are again
no large rivers, and the rainfall is even less than at
Adelaide; but there is enough to grow fine crops of
wheat. We see much the same arrangement of zones
as at the back of Sydney, but the wheat-belt is narrower
and the rainfall rather less. Very soon we drop down
into the rainless plains of the Murray basin, where the
only cultivation is in the irrigated district round
Renmark. Here we can see them drying the raisins <span class="linenum">14</span>
and loading them on to the little steamer which will
take them down to near the mouth of the river. They <span class="linenum">15</span>
will then be sent on by rail to Adelaide, since the river
has no good outlet to the sea.</p>

<p>Yorke Peninsula and the western side of Spencer
Gulf have a few small towns on the coast; inland they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
have no rivers but only dry pastures, salt lakes, and
marshes. Here is one of these lakes in the Peninsula. <span class="linenum">16</span>
The character of this district will change in the future,
as much of it is adapted for the growing of wheat
which has already been introduced. The only considerable
population at present is on the coast strip
from Adelaide to Port Augusta, and on the back of
the plateau, never more than a hundred miles from the
coast.</p>

<p>As we follow the railway northwards from Adelaide <span class="linenum">17</span>
we shall find that agriculture decreases with the decreasing
rainfall; in place of crops we see cattle and
sheep. Here is a typical station only a hundred miles <span class="linenum">18</span>
north of Adelaide, where the sheep seem to be in full
possession. The further north we go the thinner is
the settlement; and north of Port Augusta we shall
only find it at a few favoured spots near the railway.</p>

<p>Beyond Lake Torrens the plateau edge to the east
trends away and disappears, and we enter the Lake Eyre
basin. At one time this may have been a vast inland
sea, as the remains of extinct animals show that the
climate must have been very different from the present.
Now it is a great clay plain, broken by low plateaus
and ridges of sandstone, and with much of its surface
covered with stones or mulga scrub. The lakes are
salt, while the long rivers, shown on the map as flowing
into them, may be only a string of mudholes for years
together. Much of this region is still unexplored, and
nearly the whole of it is useless.</p>

<p>The railway ends at Oodnadatta, to which a train runs
at rare intervals; and off the railway the camel, which <span class="linenum">19</span>
has been introduced into Australia for this purpose, is
the only means of transport. To the east of this line
something may be made of the country by boring
through the clay to reach the artesian water, as we have
seen already in Queensland and New South Wales; so
that settlement may spread slowly towards these States.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
To the west is the arid plateau which covers so much
of the central part of the continent&mdash;the Sahara of
Australia.</p>

<p>Adelaide is a little south of Sydney in latitude, and <span class="linenum">20</span>
Oodnadatta a little south of Brisbane, yet what a
difference between the two parallel journeys by rail!
The explanation is to be found in the rainfall figures:
north of Port Augusta we enter the zone where the
annual amount is under ten inches. The railway reminds
us of those starting from the east coast and
ending at some remote point in the interior; but there
seems very little country here for our line to exploit or
develop. To understand fully its meaning we must
look back at the past history of the region.</p>

<p>South Australia was founded by an Association
formed in England with the object of building up a
model agricultural colony. The plan was to sell the
unoccupied land and use the proceeds to aid suitable
emigrants in settling there. With this idea Adelaide
was founded in 1836. For a few years the colony was
poor, as it was intended to be self-supporting and the
capital in private hands was insufficient to develop the
country. But progress was helped by the various discoveries
of copper, from 1842 onwards, at Kapunda,
Burra and other places; and by 1855 the colony
was able to export large quantities of agricultural
produce to the other colonies, which had depended
mainly on Tasmania up to this time.</p>

<p>It is curious that the State which is still mainly
agricultural was the first to develop its minerals on a
large scale; but as the mineral was copper and not
gold, it led to no rush of settlers, but only to a steady
growth of population. The older mines have been long
worked out, but those in Yorke Peninsula and in the <span class="linenum">21</span>
Flinders Range still produce large quantities. Here are
views of the Wallaroo and Moonta mines in the
Peninsula.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> <span class="linenum">22</span></p>

<p>With the exception of some iron ore, which is not
much worked, South Australia has no other important
minerals of its own: yet at Port Pirie, on the east side
of Spencer Gulf, we find large smelting works. To
explain this we must look back again at the railway
map. From the port a line runs north-east for two
hundred miles or more, to the Silverton country, just
inside the New South Wales border which we have
already visited. It is the natural outlet for this district,
as Sydney is more than twice as far away.</p>

<p>Here we see Port Pirie and some of the smelting <span class="linenum">23</span>
works. The works also handle iron ore which is brought
down to the opposite shore of the Gulf by a short railway <span class="linenum">24</span>
from Iron Knob, near Lake Gilles, in the dry
interior of the western plateau. In the case of this
district we notice once again that the artificial boundary
following a line of longitude has no correspondence
with the natural features of the country.</p>

<p>We have already seen how, on the constitution of
Queensland as a separate State in 1859, the country <span class="linenum">25</span>
to the west was left as a detached portion of New
South Wales. In 1855, Gregory had crossed what
is now the Northern Territory, from the Victoria
River in the west to the Flinders River, and so
through North Queensland to Brisbane, following the
line taken earlier by the explorer Leichhardt, but
further inland. At the same time, various explorers
had been following up Eyre’s discoveries in South
Australia, and miners and shepherds were pushing
steadily northwards from Yorke Peninsula along
the line of the present railway. In 1859, South
Australia offered a prize for the first explorer to cross
the continent from south to north, urged on by the
proposal to connect Australia with England by a cable
which must be landed somewhere on the north coast.
A party from Victoria, under Burke, started first, and
following roughly the western boundaries of New South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Wales and Queensland, came out by way of the Flinders
River to the Gulf of Carpentaria. But on their return
Burke and Wills perished at Cooper’s Creek of starvation,
and only one member of the party was rescued.</p>

<p>In 1862, Stuart, for South Australia, succeeded in
crossing to the north coast and returning to Adelaide
by the route west of Lake Eyre which is now followed
by the railway and telegraph. The immediate result
was that the Northern Territory became politically part
of South Australia, instead of being an annex to New
South Wales; but it has recently been transferred to
the Commonwealth Government by which it is now
administered. By 1872, the telegraph line was completed
to Palmerston, the northern capital, on Port
Darwin, where the cable is landed. By 1889, the
railway from the south had been pushed forward to
Oodnadatta, nearly seven hundred miles from Adelaide;
while in the north one hundred and fifty miles of line
was built southwards. Some day, probably in the near
future, the rail will stretch from shore to shore, but
there still remains a gap of over a thousand miles.</p>

<p>North of Lake Eyre, and on the Tropic, the Territory
is crossed by the Macdonell Ranges, running east
and west. Then comes a stretch of five hundred miles
of sandy plains, with scrub and spinifex, and then the
peninsula of Arnhem Land, a low plateau with a considerable
rainfall. Right on the coast are mangrove
swamps and tropical rainfall, as in North Queensland.
Though some of this country is suited to cattle, and
gold has also been discovered, progress has not been
very rapid, in spite of the importance of the magnificent
harbour of Port Darwin. The population consists of
a few hundred Europeans, as many Asiatics, mainly
Chinese, and some thousands of aborigines.</p>

<p>After Stuart’s journey there remained only to complete
the conquest of the desert from east to west. In
1840, Eyre had succeeded in travelling from Adelaide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to West Australia along the shores of the Great Australian
Bight. It was 1870 before Sir John Forrest
traversed the same route in the opposite direction.
The result was the occupation of Eucla, in the middle
of the Bight, and the completion of the overland wire
from Adelaide to Albany in 1877. Finally, in 1874,
Forrest crossed the middle of the great plateau, from
Geraldton to the north-south telegraph line. A few
daring journeys and the two telegraph lines still represent
the only land links between the detached areas
of settlement which fringe the central plateau block;
but a stronger link will soon be forged. Already the
work is in hand. A survey of the route was completed
in 1909 by the Federal Government; and at the end
of 1911 a Bill was passed for the construction of a railway
from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, a distance of over
1000 miles. This line will not only shorten the mail
route to the eastern States, but may also lead to some
pastoral settlement, as not all the country traversed
is desert.</p>

<p>South and Western Australia, with the Northern
Territory, together include nearly two-thirds of the
continent. Western Australia alone includes nearly
a third. It is rather more than five times the size
of Spain, but its population is smaller than that of
any of the States of the mainland. The reason for this
contrast is partly a matter of history, as the State is
comparatively young, and partly due to geographical
causes, as we shall see when we have examined the
country.</p>

<p>The map shows Western Australia stretching from <span class="linenum">26</span>
north to south, across the whole breadth of the continent,
with the Tropic running through the middle. It
corresponds in position to Queensland and New South
Wales; for Cape Londonderry is in the same latitude as
the middle of Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, while
Albany is a little south of Sydney. The greater part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the State is occupied by a broad plateau, from a thousand
to fifteen hundred feet high; between this and the sea
is a narrow coastal plain, irregular and deeply indented
in the north, narrower and more uniform towards the
south, and disappearing in the south-west corner where
the plateau edge approaches the sea. We may notice
a certain likeness here to the structure of the eastern
end of the continent. We shall find nearly the whole
of the agricultural population collected along a comparatively
narrow belt of country from Geraldton to
Albany, with Perth, the capital, in the middle. On the
plateau there are no great rivers, but many short
streams run down from its western edge to the sea;
and though the map shows large lakes in the interior
we shall find that in this case the map is not entirely
to be trusted.</p>

<p>The Swan River was discovered by Captain Stirling
on his exploring mission from Sydney in 1827. Two
years later Captain Fremantle took formal possession,
and the Swan River Settlement was founded. The
Home Government was at first doubtful about the
project, but was urged on to the settlement through
fear of French occupation. Perth itself lies twelve <span class="linenum">27</span>
miles up the river; its port is Fremantle, at the mouth
of the river, on a deep and safe harbour, crowded with <span class="linenum">28</span>
wharves and shipping. It is the main outlet for the
trade of all this part of Western Australia.</p>

<p>Instead of taking the train we will travel by launch
up the Swan River; on our way we notice the large <span class="linenum">29</span>
flocks of black swans which are now collected here and
preserved by the Government. The city of Perth is
smaller and more irregular than Adelaide or Melbourne,
and we see it at its best as we approach by the river.
It lies rather in a hollow, and from the higher land in <span class="linenum">30</span>
the King’s Park we get a fine view along the river
front. The main streets differ little from those of
other Australian cities; but in St. George’s Terrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> <span class="linenum">31</span>
they are working on the road, and we notice that
the old tree stumps are not yet removed. Although
Perth is making very rapid progress, everything is
as yet somewhat quieter, more picturesque and on a
smaller scale than in the great capitals of the eastern
States. On the outskirts of the city, especially overlooking
the river, are the gardens and houses of the
wealthier residents. Here is one of these; notice the <span class="linenum">32</span>
lemon trees laden with fruit, although it is winter. In
the country round we shall feel quite at home. Here
we have a picture with pasture and scattered trees and
fat cattle; and we pass a poultry farm which might <span class="linenum">33</span>
well be in a corner of Surrey.</p>

<p>Let us follow the Swan, now become the Avon River,
inland. First we come to Newcastle, where there are
many orange orchards in the broad valley; then we pass
the township of Northam, where we meet a native woman <span class="linenum">34</span>
on the road, and finally we reach York. From one of the
surrounding hills we look down on a broad expanse of <span class="linenum">35</span>
plain, dotted with farmhouses, and with a background
of hills in the distance. There is a flour mill which <span class="linenum">36</span>
might be in our own Yorkshire, and a very English-looking
church on the sloping bank above the river. <span class="linenum">37</span>
All looks settled and civilised. On the other hand,
the King’s Head hotel is entirely primitive, and carries <span class="linenum">38</span>
us back to the days of the early settlers, as it is one of
the oldest buildings in the State. As we cross the
bridge we notice that the trees are standing in the
water, for the river is in flood.</p>

<p>We have here a country full of English place-names,
and with scenery which often reminds us of England;
but at the same time we find wheat and oranges growing
side by side, and trees in fruit and flower in the
winter. This suggests something very different from
our own climate. We must remember that Perth is in
latitude 32° S. and that this district therefore corresponds
to Egypt or Morocco. It is a land where frosts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
are unknown in the lowlands and valleys near the sea,
and where the summers are hot and dry, though
tempered by the sea breezes. Most of the rain falls in
the winter, which is therefore the growing time; we
have already noticed the Avon in flood. Even in the
winter there is plenty of sun, as the rain falls largely in
heavy showers at night.</p>

<span class="smcap">Western Australia: Rainfall.</span></div>
</div>

<p>If we travel eastward from York we shall soon find <span class="linenum">39</span>
a change in the face of the country, as the rainfall
decreases quickly towards
the interior.
But for the present we
will keep within the
zone of moderate rainfall,
not far from the
coast, and continue
our journey southwards.
Much of the
land round Perth has
been cleared for agriculture,
though it was
formerly covered with
forest. Beginning north
of Perth, and stretching
southwards at a
distance of twenty to
thirty miles from the
coast, is a long belt of
timber-country, marking
the zone of heaviest
rainfall. This belt
broadens out and fills the whole peninsula in the south-west
corner, between Flinders Bay and Geographe Bay,
and finally disappears a few miles to the north-east
of Albany. The dense forest clothes the western face
of the plateau, and thins out eastward to open scrub
country with scattered gum trees of various kinds. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
consists in the main of Jarrah, with some blocks of
Karri in the south and south-west.</p>

<p>Jarrah is a very hard red-coloured wood which is
useful for jetties, railway sleepers and all other work
where there is great exposure to damp and weather.
We may often walk over it in the streets of our cities,
as it makes an excellent pavement. Here we see the
appearance of the original tree: it is tall, perhaps a <span class="linenum">40</span>
hundred feet high, with a trunk a yard or more thick
and a dark-grey furrowed bark.</p>

<p>With the Jarrah is found the Karri, of much the
same character but less durable. It is one of the finest
and tallest trees of the Australian forest. Its bark is
yellowish white, and peels off, leaving the tree clean,
so that the Karri is sometimes called the white gum.
The tree sometimes grows to a height of three hundred <span class="linenum">41</span>
feet, and is far too large to handle; while even the
smaller specimens need a whole team to haul a single
log. So that, although there is a very large area of
forest land, we can understand that cutting only goes
on within easy reach of one of the short branch railway
lines running down to the sea. The forests of Western
Australia have recently been estimated to contain two
hundred and twenty million tons of valuable timber,
worth about three hundred million pounds sterling.</p>

<p>Where the forest thins out eastward the red gum
is one of the most useful trees, as it is spreading and <span class="linenum">42</span>
branched, and so gives more shade than the other
gum trees. This is important for the stockowner in
a dry, hot country.</p>

<p>We have already seen something of the agricultural
district round York; and we shall find little difference
as we follow the railway southwards to Albany, keeping
always about a hundred miles from the coast. There
are the same wheatfields and sheep and occasional
orchards; it is not very different from the country
round Perth, except that it is rather cooler as we travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
southwards. In the summer, especially on the eastern
edge of this belt, it is very dry and parched; but after
the winter rains, though there is too little water for
trees, the flowers and grasses spring up everywhere,
especially everlasting flowers which grow in great
profusion, as we see from the picture before us. <span class="linenum">43</span></p>

<p>So we have a coast belt associated with timber, and
a parallel belt inland where agriculture is developing
along the track of the railway. The southern terminus <span class="linenum">44</span>
of the railway is Albany, on King George’s Sound, one
of the best harbours of the Australian continent. <span class="linenum">45</span>
Albany is a fortified coaling port, and is likely to grow
in importance with the organisation of Australian
defence in the future. This seems a small corner on
the map, yet the area available for agriculture is considerably
larger than the total area under cultivation
in Great Britain; while beyond it, in the region of lessening
rainfall, is a wide belt suited for sheep-raising.
Further eastward still, beyond this belt, we enter
another type of country. The railway from Northam
Junction carries us across the dry country and through
Southern Cross to the mining centre of Coolgardie.
A little further on, at Kalgoorlie, it turns northward,
to end at Laverton, about four hundred miles from
Perth and the same distance from the sea to the south.
This is the limit of that part of West Australian settlement
which is based on gold.</p>

<p>The gold-bearing country is in two bands, running
north and south, through Southern Cross and Kalgoorlie;
and we find quite a large population in the
midst of waterless country. Here is a view of Kalgoorlie,
a prosperous-looking town, in spite of its arid <span class="linenum">46</span>
surroundings. This is the region of Australia where
gold-mining has developed most rapidly in recent
years. It is very different from Ballarat or the Queensland
mines, where the gold lies in the midst of a fertile
agricultural country, easily reached from the sea.</p>

<p>After leaving the agricultural belt we pass through a
stony country with low hills covered with deadwood
and scrub. Yet the map shows us many lakes and
pools, and as it is winter we shall find them according
to our expectations. Here is a pool of fresh water <span class="linenum">47</span>
just after the rains; notice that it even has trees
growing round it. Here again is one of the larger <span class="linenum">48</span>
lakes; though there seems to be plenty of water here
it is really only a flat clay marsh, flooded to the depth
of a few inches. Notice the gold mine in the distance.
In the hot weather the water in these shallow lakes
soon evaporates, often leaving a deposit of salt, so that
in place of a sheet of water there is a dreary clay flat
covered with stones. On these flats near the shrunken <span class="linenum">49</span>
lakes the only vegetation is the salt-bush, with occasional
patches of very dry scrub.</p>

<p>There is nothing to attract the settler to country
such as this, except gold. There is little water, and
that mostly salt or brackish, so that in the early days
of the mines it was distilled and sold by the gallon
at a high price. There was none available for washing
the gold, so that it had to be separated from the earth
and rock by the method known as dry-blowing. Now
all this has been changed. The mines are supplied
with water from far away in the Perth district,
where the rainfall is heavy. The whole river is held
up at Mundaring, twenty-one miles from Perth, by a <span class="linenum">50</span>
gigantic weir, and the water is raised at one pumping
station after another, and so carried up and over
the plateau to the mining districts. The pipes are laid
along the railway and the water is carried for about three
hundred and fifty miles, or rather further than from
London to Berwick. Without this great work, the
Coolgardie region, with its large mining population,
could not exist.</p>

<p>Let us now examine the mining. Here we see its
primitive methods in the bush. There is probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> <span class="linenum">51</span>
alluvial gold in the bed of a stream, buried under the
surface sand and clay. The stuff is merely hauled up <span class="linenum">52</span>
in buckets and thrown out on to the “dump” to await
further treatment. Here again, instead of sinking a <span class="linenum">53</span>
shaft, the miners have burrowed into the bare hillside.
In some places, where water is to be had for a short
time after the rains, the miners contrive a primitive <span class="linenum">54</span>
washing machine such as we see here. The large
trough is merely a hollow log, where the gold-bearing
dirt is washed to free it from clay, while the larger
stones are picked out. Then it is put into the long
trough and sluiced, so that the gold settles among the
small stones while the lighter stuff is carried away.
The troughs are of wood and the pump is distinctly
home made; the water is used again and again until
it becomes too thick or evaporates altogether.</p>

<p>Now let us turn to another picture. Here is an
up-to-date mine, with machinery and tanks for the <span class="linenum">55</span>
chemical extraction of the last atom of gold, after the
mass has already been treated in great batteries. <span class="linenum">56</span>
There is a deep shaft here with mechanical winding as
in a coal mine; but often the gold-bearing quartz is
near the surface, and we have an “open cut,” or <span class="linenum">57</span>
practically a quarry. Here is one showing the rock at
close quarters: the white is the rock which contains <span class="linenum">58</span>
the gold, while the dark is the “mullock,” or “country”
rock, as the miners style it. There are other goldfields
nearer the coast, in the district north-east of Perth.
Although near the sea this is a very dry country with
much mulga scrub; for, as we go northwards, the
scanty rainfall is more and more limited to a very
narrow strip along the coast. We have noticed already
that the forest zone ends not far north of Perth.</p>

<p>The rest of the interior in this part of the State
is a stony desert whose chief product is the spinifex,
or porcupine grass, which we have seen before. This
often forms an impenetrable scrub, as many explorers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
have found to their cost. Over very large areas the
surface is covered with great boulders; these may be
troublesome to the traveller, but they are not without
their uses. The storm water runs off them and does
not contain salt, so that it can be caught in a tank for <span class="linenum">59</span>
the cattle on the stock routes, as we see in this picture.</p>

<p>In the south-east, towards the great Australian
Bight, there is a change. There is much limestone
country here, with pasture, but the water sinks away
through the porous rock. Access, too, is difficult,
owing to the cliff barrier stretching for fifteen hundred
miles unbroken by any stream or gap. Here is a view <span class="linenum">60</span>
of these cliffs; sometimes they come down to the sea,
sometimes they lie some distance inland, but they are
always present. Here, too, we find the water, which
sank into the plateau above, breaking out at the foot <span class="linenum">61</span>
of the cliffs and giving us unexpected vegetation.</p>

<p>One part of West Australia we have not visited,
that beyond the Tropic to the north. Here is a
moderate rainfall similar to that in the Northern
Territory and in Queensland; while in the extreme
north we meet the heavy downpour of the Tropics.
Much of it is well suited for cattle, but at present it is
hardly touched, and it is separated from the populous
district of the south by a wide stretch of dry and inhospitable
country.</p>

<span class="fs80">NEW ZEALAND&mdash;SOUTH ISLAND</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">We now return to the east and leave Hobart, with a
westerly wind astern, and following the course of the
great Dutch navigator Tasman, steam south-eastward
across the deep sea which still bears his name. We
are bound for the southern end of New Zealand.</p>

<p>The islands of New Zealand are often compared
to the British Islands, but we must be careful not to
press this comparison too far. We must notice that
their position on the globe corresponds not to that of
Britain, but to that of Italy; while the long toe to the
north is even nearer to the equator than the toe of Italy.
In shape, too, the main islands remind us somewhat of
Italy; for Cook Strait is shallow, and we may think
of them as forming one continuous land mass. We
may notice also that Stewart Island lies on a bank
which extends from the mainland southwards as far
as the Auckland Islands. There are similar shallows
to the northward, with island points upon them projecting
above the surface of the sea; so that we may
think of the whole area as one great bank below the
water, with the higher parts showing as land, while east
and west of it lie the deep abysses of the Tasman Sea
and the Pacific. So though we have at first sight a
group of scattered islands, they have a certain unity
if we look at the under-sea platform on which they
stand. There are also certain scattered islands, more
remote from the New Zealand group, but dependent
politically on the Dominion. Of these the chief are the
Chatham Islands, 500 miles east of Lyttelton, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Kermadecs, 600 miles north-east of Auckland, and
beyond them the Cook Islands, far out in the Pacific.</p>

<p>Though in shape and position New Zealand may
resemble Italy, in one important respect it differs alike
from Italy and the British Islands. It is surrounded
by the open ocean, and there is no great continent
near enough to affect its climate or the life of its people.
Its plants and animals are largely peculiar to itself;
its native races are widely different from the aborigines
of Australia; its past development has been on
independent lines, and we may remember that it still
remains outside the circle of Australian Federation.
We may contrast the position of Italy, in a land-locked
sea and with a continental frontier; or the close connexion
with the neighbouring mainland which has
affected all the past history of our own islands.</p>

<p>We are visiting South Island first, since its geography
is more simple and easier to grasp than that
of the North Island; we shall find, too, that some
of the conditions are not unlike those which we have
lately seen in Tasmania. Our steamer will land us <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 1</span>
at Bluff Harbour, in the extreme south of the island.
Fifteen miles away, across Foveaux Strait, we can
distinguish the hills of Stewart Island, famous for its
oysters. Bluff is the port of Invercargill which lies
some distance up the estuary of the New River, and is
not visited by large vessels. It is a busy little town,
and here we see the steamers loading wool, frozen meat,
and perhaps oats. The tall chimney in the background
belongs to one of the largest meat-freezing factories in
the colony, while that smooth green mass is the Bluff
itself. The wharves of a seaport are an excellent guide
to the district which it serves; and wool, meat, and oats
may suggest to us the nature of the country which we
are about to visit.</p>

<p>A journey of seventeen miles by rail brings us to
Invercargill. We have seen the products of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
at the port; here we shall learn something more of
the people who own them. Invercargill is a grey,
solid-looking town, with very wide and clean streets
and a general air of comfort and prosperity. The
town is full of people who have come in for the great
summer wool sales. Among the crowd we come across
some highland pipers&mdash;a rather surprising meeting in
the southern hemisphere. Our surprise will not last
long. Let us look around us: here are Dee Street and <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 2</span>
Don Street, whose very names, like that of the town
itself, carry us back to Scotland. Or let us look at the
people and listen to their talk: we shall find Scots
everywhere, not in this town only, but all over the south
of the island. In fact, the original settlement at
Otago, which we shall visit later, was a Scottish Free
Kirk colony.</p>

<p>From Invercargill we can reach the mountains of the
south-west and some of the most magnificent scenery
in the southern hemisphere; but before we start we <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 3</span>
must take a brief glance at the island as a whole. The
country which is to be surveyed is about the same
size as England and Wales. We remember that we
approached it from the west but landed in the extreme
south; the map may suggest a reason for this. Not
far from the west coast, from end to end of the island,
runs a backbone of mountains, with a steep face
towards the Tasman Sea but a long and more gentle
slope to the Pacific. Thus the rivers flowing to the
west are short and rapid, for the most part mere
mountain torrents, of no use for ships; while their
narrow, deep-cut valleys give little space for settlement
or roads into the interior. Their mouths also are
blocked by sand-bars, owing to the strong winds and
currents which sweep along the coast.</p>

<p>In the south-west corner, instead of rivers, we
find a whole group of fiords, deep inlets running up
between mountain walls and leading nowhere. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
is some of the most beautiful but least known
country in New Zealand; there are no railways
and practically no settlement, as we shall find on
our visit. In short, the island looks to the Pacific
and turns its back on the Tasman Sea. On the
east side there is more room. The province of Otago
is hilly, but further north is the great expanse of
the Canterbury Plains. North of the plains are more
mountains, the Kaikoura Ranges, lying parallel to the
east coast; so that even on this side of the island
there is no through communication from end to end.
We shall see later that this peculiar grouping of the
physical features has had a great deal of influence on
the nature and history of settlement in South Island,
or Middle Island as some prefer to call it.</p>

</div>

<p>We will now start on our trip to the mountains,
lakes, and fiords of the south-west. The first part of
our journey is by train, past fields of oats and rough
grazing land with sheep scattered about, and here and
there a clump of firs. Soon we are running through a
valley between the hills, and following the line of a
grey-looking stream, to the town of Lumsden. We <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 4</span>
are coming to the end of the railway and must change
into a motor car to complete our journey. Our destination
is the beautiful Lake Manapouri, one of a group
of lakes which wind in and out among the valleys of
the western mountains just as the fiords which run
in from the sea. Here is a piece of our road, with the
mountains in the distance; notice the team of horses <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 5</span>
carting wool.</p>

<p>We sleep at an accommodation house, and in the early <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 6</span>
morning go down to the little pier and board the launch
which is to take us up the lake. Here we see it lying <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 7</span>
below one of the tree-clad slopes. In the distance,
veiled in cloud, are the Hunter Mountains; here is a <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 8</span>
nearer view from which we can form some idea of the
wonderful colours in which these mountain lakes
abound. Further up the lake on the north side we see <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 9</span>
the Cathedral Peaks, with patches of snow still lying,
although it is past midsummer; while all the lower
slopes, right down to the water’s edge, are covered with
green beech, called birch by the natives, with here and
there the scarlet blossoms of the <em>rata</em> tree making a
patch of bright colour. Finally we see the end of the
northern arm, with Spire Peak shooting up in the <span class="linenum">10</span>
background.</p>

<p>From Manapouri we drive across to another lake,
Te Anau, where we again find a launch. From the
northern end of this long, narrow and somewhat uninteresting
lake we must walk the thirty miles over
the Milford track, if we wish to see Milford Sound, one
of the grandest of all the sea fiords. We are now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
beginning to realise how very much out of the world
we are in this corner of the island.</p>

<p>Our path lies for many miles through a dense forest
of beech. From the roots, and far up the trunks, the
trees are covered with mosses, lichens, and small ferns.
On the ground are more thick mosses and myriads of
ferns great and small. Everything is moist and green
in this part of the island, where the perpetual westerly
winds bring heavy rain all the year round to the
mountain slopes. In fact, we shall be lucky if we finish
our walk without meeting with a downpour. Here we
see part of our track on the way up to the Mackinnon <span class="linenum">11</span>
Pass, with the dense bush below and the snow-capped
mountains above. All the way through the trees we <span class="linenum">12</span>
have glimpses of cataracts, seaming the rugged slopes
above the limit of the forest. Many of the torrent
beds are dry now, like the one in front of us, but we <span class="linenum">13</span>
can easily imagine the force of the flood water from
the appearance of the stones and debris strewn about it.</p>

<p>It is a long walk, and we stop for the night, wet
and tired, at the Government huts at Pompolona,
where we sleep, if we can, in rough wooden bunks
fixed round the inside of the walls. In the early
morning we start again, making our way by the side
of the Clinton River which flows down the pass between
dark woods not yet touched by the sunshine. So we <span class="linenum">14</span>
go on over the Divide and down the valley of the
Arthur River, through more dense jungle of tree ferns,
to Sandfly Point, on Milford Sound, where Donald
Sutherland is to meet us with his launch. It is growing
late, and there are sandflies in plenty, but no sign
of the launch or its independent owner. Sutherland
was the original discoverer of the Sound and of the
famous falls named after him, and for a long time he
lived here in sole possession. He is now a kind of
guide and guardian of its magnificent scenery, and has
the air of a landowner showing visitors over his private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
estate. Here is his portrait, that of a typical blue-eyed
Scot. He arrives at last and takes us by moonlight <span class="linenum">15</span>
to the little landing near his house.</p>

<p>In the morning we make a voyage down the Sound.
All around us are steep mountain slopes with wisps of
cloud hanging upon them not yet dissipated by the
sun. At the head of the Sound we can see the Bowen <span class="linenum">16</span>
Falls, and our boat will take us right up to their foot for
a closer view. We pass Mitre Peak, with its remarkable <span class="linenum">17</span>
shape, and then are shown Two Man Beach, where
Sutherland landed first with one companion, prospecting <span class="linenum">18</span>
for gold, thirty years ago. The rock above is dark
purple-grey, with splashes of green and scarlet from the
small trees clinging to it and the blossom of the <em>rata</em>.
Finally we reach the Heads and the open sea, and <span class="linenum">19</span>
turning look back. Notice how the mountain walls
close in on the blue-black water. Sheer above the
surface they tower for half to three-quarters of a mile,
carved and polished by the great glacier which filled
the Sound long ages ago. We may see something
like this in the West of Scotland, though on a far smaller
scale; but to find a close parallel we shall have to
search among the fiords of Norway. Here is a map
showing the district of the Sounds. When we have <span class="linenum">20</span>
seen Milford, we have seen the essence of all the thirteen
Sounds; though each has its own special beauty; so
we start on our long tramp back, turning aside a mile or
two from the Quinton Huts to visit the Sutherland Falls, <span class="linenum">21</span>
which claim to be the highest in the world; and so to
our motor car for Lumsden and the railway to Dunedin.</p>

<p>Before reaching Dunedin we cross the Clutha, one
of the largest of the New Zealand rivers, as it drains
three lakes among the mountains, and these in their
turn are fed from the snows of the southern Alps.
The river flows for the most part through a narrow
rock-bound channel, in hilly country, and so has no
broad valley for settlement; but its sands are rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in alluvial gold, and we may perhaps catch sight of an <span class="linenum">22</span>
ugly floating dredger, moored in the stream. Much of
the gold in New Zealand is alluvial, and dredging for
it in the river-bed is one of the most common and
profitable methods of mining. This part of Otago
owes its population and prosperity almost entirely to
its gold and the sheep which are scattered everywhere
over its rolling downs; in the west, as we have already
seen, it is occupied by mountain, fiord, and forest, and
is scarcely inhabited.</p>

<p>Dunedin, the Edinburgh of New Zealand, is the
most important commercial city in the South Island.
It is much larger than Invercargill and has many fine
buildings of the Oamaru stone, the best building stone
to be found in the island. Here was the original
Scottish settlement in 1848, and the natural outlet of
the rich gold and pastoral district behind. The city
lies at the head of a long inlet, Otago Harbour, which <span class="linenum">23</span>
is formed by a narrow peninsula connected only by a
small neck with the mainland. The peninsula and the
surrounding hills together make a kind of funnel through
which sweep the winds from the north-east or south-west.
It is always cool and breezy here, a fit place
for a strong, healthy, and energetic race; but people
coming from the warmer regions of the North Island
do not always appreciate the change. Here we have
a wide view of the town and harbour, looking northwards, <span class="linenum">24</span>
from the Town Belt, a fine stretch of public
land on the hillside encircling the city. Here is a nearer
view from which we can gain some notion of the size <span class="linenum">25</span>
and character of the city itself. Notice the church
spires, the tall factory chimneys, the warehouses and
offices. Dunedin has its flour mills, its woollen mills,
its manufactures of boots and clothing. Here is the
interior of one of the large woollen mills, showing the <span class="linenum">26</span>
combing and spinning machines; we might easily
imagine ourselves in Yorkshire. Another picture gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
us a glimpse of one of the many beauty spots on the <span class="linenum">27</span>
coast within a short distance of the city.</p>

<p>Just as the ocean trade of Invercargill was carried
on at Bluff, so the outlet for Dunedin and the usual
landing-place for large steamers is at Port Chalmers, <span class="linenum">28</span>
some miles further down the inlet; though a recently
dredged channel now enables them to reach the wharves
of Dunedin itself. Here we see the port from the west,
looking towards the sea. Dunedin is the headquarters
of the largest steamship company in the southern
hemisphere; the company trades especially with the
coast ports of New Zealand and with Australia. It is a
curious accident which has given us a fine harbour in
this position. The east coast, like the west, takes the
form of long, smooth bights, with very few natural
harbours. The peninsula which forms Otago Inlet is
volcanic in origin, as is the larger Banks Peninsula
further north. There are no live volcanoes in South
Island; but these interesting relics of past activity
have proved of the greatest value to settlement.
They even attracted here the Maoris, who confined
themselves for the most part to North Island.</p>

<p>We must now resume our journey, by the trunk <span class="linenum">29</span>
line of railway, which follows the coast all the way,
with occasional branches running inland between the
south-eastern spurs of the central mountain chain.
We pass Oamaru, whence comes the stone for many
of the public buildings of New Zealand, and stop at
Timaru, where we change trains. We are going up
one of the branch lines to visit another district of
magnificent scenery, though quite different from the
southern lakes and fiords. This is the district of the
New Zealand Alps, the Switzerland of the southern
hemisphere. At Fairlie the railway ends and we must
once again trust to a motor car. In the distance, as
we start in the early morning, we see a great mass of
snow-capped mountains: this is our goal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Our road at first lies across a flat plain, with sheep
and cattle, and here and there a field of corn or a clump
of trees and an isolated homestead. Then we reach
Burke’s Pass, with its firs and poplars and little group <span class="linenum">30</span>
of houses. Mount Cook, the highest peak in the
island, is just visible in the distance. We are crossing
over one of the long spurs which spread eastward
from the main chain. Soon we find the mountains,
with snow peaks, closing in on either side, as well as
in front, and so we come down to Lake Tekapo. <span class="linenum">31</span></p>

<p>Here we cross the end of the lake by a suspension
bridge; notice how the light is reflected from the
snow on the summit of the mighty range in front of us.
Next we come on a sight peculiar to the country; this
is a boundary dog, a lonely sentry chained up at a <span class="linenum">32</span>
point where the boundary of a sheep run crosses the
road and there is no gate to prevent the sheep from
straying. Around him is a heap of bones, the remnants
of many meals. Then we reach another lake, Pukaki,
with its chalky-looking water; and in the distance up <span class="linenum">33</span>
the lake we have a view of the great mass of Mount
Cook. We drive along the lake side right into the
heart of the mountains, and in the evening reach the
Hermitage at the foot of Mount Sefton. Here is a view <span class="linenum">34</span>
of Mount Sefton and here are the Hermitage and the
mountain as we should see them in winter. <span class="linenum">35</span></p>

<p>We sleep at the Hermitage, and in the morning start
with a guide and the usual equipment of the climber
in Switzerland. We cross the Hooker River by a <span class="linenum">36</span>
suspended cage; the water looks quiet enough now,
but here it is in flood; a very different picture. All <span class="linenum">37</span>
along the west coast there are mountain streams of
this kind; and we can easily imagine what a serious
barrier they offer to movement from north to south
across the line of their channels.</p>

<p>It would be impossible, without a large scale map
and plenty of space, to describe the wonders which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
can see on a two days’ walk, sleeping at Ball Hut, a
long way up the mountain slopes. But we may gain
some notion of the different kinds of scenery to be
found. All around us are snow-clad peaks, with great
glaciers flowing down the valleys between and ending
in long moraines&mdash;masses of rock and debris with chalk-white
streams flowing out from beneath them as in
the picture before us. This is the Mueller Glacier with <span class="linenum">38</span>
Mount Sefton; and the river coming out from the
terminal face is the Hooker, which we crossed earlier <span class="linenum">39</span>
at a lower point in its course. Here again we are looking
up the famous Tasman Glacier, towards the Minarets,
and here is the wonderful scene at the head of the <span class="linenum">40</span>
glacier. On the same glacier we find a beautiful
specimen of the ice river; and not far away, on the <span class="linenum">41</span>
great Hochstetter, we see some magnificent ice falls.
In the background is Mount Silberhorn. The picture <span class="linenum">42</span>
suggests the origin of the name. Finally we have a
view of Mount Cook, the Aorangi of the Maoris, with <span class="linenum">43</span>
its topmost peaks rising into the clouds. It is the
highest mountain in Australasia, and we have already
seen it in various aspects from a distance. Here is <span class="linenum">44</span>
the summit, twelve thousand feet above the level of
the sea, or nearly three times the height of Ben Nevis.
Mount Cook is worthy to stand by the side of the giant
peaks of the Alps, and even in Switzerland it would
be difficult to find scenery grander than that of these
southern mountains.</p>

<p>We must not spend too much time here, so we make
our way back to Timaru. Timaru is a small but busy
town and port, with flour mills, meat-freezing works,
and steamers loading at its wharves. We must pause
here for a moment as we are entering on a new region
in South Island, very different from those which
we have visited. Timaru is the chief outlet for the
centre and south of the province of Canterbury.
The eastern part of the province consists of a strip of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
level or gently undulating country, a hundred and
fifty miles from north to south and from thirty to
forty from east to west. This plain slopes gently
from the foothills of the western mountains, and has
been built up largely of alluvium brought down by the
rivers which now flow across it in shifting channels
through wide belts of shingle. It is a sharp contrast
to the forest regions of the west: a land of comparatively
small rainfall, with pastures, hedgerows, and
open cornlands; treeless except for scattered clumps,
planted by the settlers. Dropped suddenly in this
district we might easily imagine that we were somewhere
in the Midlands of England.</p>

<p>On these treeless plains and the eastern slopes of <span class="linenum">45</span>
the hills, the early settlers found pasture ready-made
for their flocks; as there was no clearing of forest to be
done. So, to-day, this part of South Island has still the
most important sheep-rearing industry in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Here is a typical farm near the foothills, with <span class="linenum">46</span>
cattle feeding on the rich pasture. Again, we have a
scene nearer Canterbury, showing a great expanse of <span class="linenum">47</span>
grain, with the reapers at work. The rainfall is so
small that in some parts of the plain there is not enough
water for the farmer, so that artificial irrigation is <span class="linenum">48</span>
necessary, and there are now many miles of water
races strung across the country. It seems strange to
talk of drought and irrigation after our experiences
of the west coast, but we may understand it better if
we look at the figures of annual rainfall. At Hokitika,
and all along the west coast as far north as Greymouth,
the fall is a hundred inches or more; while in the
extreme south-west corner it is over two hundred. On
the other hand, all the low-lying parts of the Canterbury
Plains have less than thirty inches; in fact, we may
compare them to the east and south-east districts of
England. In England, as in South Island, we find
heavy rains in the west, and the explanation is similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in both cases. The prevailing moist winds are from the
west, so that the eastern plains lie under the lee of the
mountains.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i116.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">South Island: Rainfall.</span></div>
</div>

<p>If we remember the latitude of South Island we
might expect to find it rather warm; but we must
take account of other things than latitude. It is true
that there are occasional hot winds blowing down
from the mountains over the Canterbury Plains, but
the island as a whole is cool. The great mass of
highland, with its winter covering of snow, the perpetual
moist winds and the cool currents of the ocean all help
to modify the heat of the sun’s rays, and to give us a
climate not in the least enervating for English settlers.</p>

<p>As we approach Christchurch the farms are closer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
together and the whole country is enclosed and cultivated.
For mile after mile we run past green hedgerows
as in England; and in the spring these are ablaze with
the yellow of the gorse blossom, while the scent hangs
heavy in the air. Then, through suburbs with villas
and gardens, we reach the city itself. Christchurch
is as typically English as Dunedin is Scotch. It was
founded by an association of High Churchmen who
bought land from the New Zealand Land Company
in 1850, and it still boasts the only cathedral in the
Dominion. Here is a general view of the city. We <span class="linenum">49</span>
shall find much to remind us of England in the
social life, the clubs and sports of the city, and
its beautiful park planted with English trees. The
Avon flows through it, with its riverside houses whose
lawns slope down to the banks; there are willows <span class="linenum">50</span>
overhanging the water and swans swimming about,
and the whole scene might be taken for a quiet <span class="linenum">51</span>
backwater on the Thames. It is often said that
emigrants from Britain carry a piece of their homeland
with them; there can be no better illustration
of this than Christchurch and Dunedin.</p>

<p>The cathedral, the parks and gardens and beautiful
residences show us one side of English life; but
Christchurch has another side. Its people are not
idle. We see here warehouses, offices, and busy
factories, as befits the chief centre of the whole Canterbury
district. In one respect, however, it differs from
the other large cities of New Zealand; it is not on the
sea. We shall see its trade and shipping at Lyttelton, <span class="linenum">52</span>
seven miles away by rail. Lyttelton lies on an arm of
the sea to the north of the Banks Peninsula, a volcanic <span class="linenum">53</span>
mass breaking the line of the long smooth coast, just
as the Otago Peninsula at Dunedin. But the activities
of the two cities are not the same: Dunedin, the outlet
of the coal and gold-mining area of Otago, has its
School of Mines, as well as of medicine and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
subjects; while Christchurch, the city of the fertile
plain, in addition to a great engineering department,
has its Lincoln Agricultural College. Here are the
college buildings, and here we see some of the students <span class="linenum">54</span>
at practical work, threshing wheat in the fields. Thus
we see a contrast which is purely geographical reflected <span class="linenum">55</span>
in the world of education.</p>

<p>If we follow the great plain northwards from
Christchurch, we shall find that it narrows gradually
and comes to an end at last, against the seaward range
of the Kaikoura Mountains. Our road north is stopped,
but we can follow the railway north-westward to
Springfield; thence we go by coach, over the Alps
through Arthur’s Pass and down the Otira Gorge, until
we strike the short railway which will take us to
Greymouth and the west coast. This is the only coach
road over the Alps, and we can learn much in the
course of our exciting forty mile run.</p>

<p>We climb up, by a twisting road, over open slopes
covered with brown tussock grass. Here and there we
pass a mountain tarn, and all the time above us are
purple mountains capped with dazzling fields of snow. <span class="linenum">56</span>
We cross the saddle at the summit of the pass, 3000 feet
above the sea, and then plunge down through a deep
cañon gorge, following the narrow bed of a mountain <span class="linenum">57</span>
stream. Instead of the open mountain side, all around
us are high fern-clad cliffs, steep slopes and dense
forest, all ablaze in summer with the scarlet rata
blossom. We have seen, on our short journey, the
east and the west countries, in the sharpest possible
contrast. Soon, the rail-heads on either side will be
linked, and a rush through miles of dark tunnel will
take the place of the splendid drive on the coach,
though doubtless many will still prefer the road to
the rail.</p>

<p>From Greymouth another line of rail and coach
will take us through another famous gorge on a zigzag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
course to Nelson on Tasman Bay. We realise that
communication in this part of the island is very
difficult, and we shall find that the isolation of the
different areas of settlement has been an important
factor in the political development of New Zealand.</p>

<p>Greymouth, on a small artificial harbour at the
mouth of the river, carries on a trade in gold, coal, and
timber; Westport, further north, owes its existence
mainly to coal, though there are also gold mines in
the country behind it. Hokitika, which we can reach
by a short railway journey, southward from Greymouth,
is also the outlet of a gold district. The coal in this
district of Westland is of good quality, and some day
may give rise to a large industrial population; at present
it is mined chiefly for export. Here we see the little
township of Brunner, with its coal mines; notice the <span class="linenum">58</span>
forest and mountain in the background. Round
Nelson there is a strip of sheltered lowland noted for its
agriculture and fruit growing; as it was easily reached,
and near the line of traffic through Cook Strait, the
district with its fertile soil and mild climate was one of
the earliest to attract settlers. Here is a view of Nelson <span class="linenum">59</span>
on its little plain ringed in by bare hills.</p>

<p>The mountainous north-east corner of the island,
now the district of Marlborough, was difficult of access;
so for a long time it had no separate existence, but was <span class="linenum">60</span>
merely part of the larger province of Nelson; but now
we may reach it easily by steamer and might spend
many days exploring the inner coast and bays of the
Sounds which penetrate deeply into the land. These
Sounds are different from those which we visited in the
south-west of the island. They are broad, lake-like
expanses of calm water, backed by forested hill slopes,
with here and there clearings and farms near the water’s
edge. The early whalers established themselves here,
and to-day it is a favourite haunt of the yachtsmen.
Here is a view of part of Pelorus Sound.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> <span class="linenum">61</span></p>

<p>If we look at the structure of the island, we now
see that there were three detached areas favourable for
early settlement; Nelson in the north, Canterbury in
the middle, and Otago in the south. All these were
occupied separately, between the years 1840 and 1850,
and the only means of communication between them
was by sea. We can understand why at first these
districts formed independent Provinces, each with its
own local Parliament. Indeed, for a few years, even the
southern part of Otago enjoyed a separate existence as
Southland. The provinces still remain as provincial
districts for certain purposes of local government,
though Westland, between the Alps and the sea, has
been split off from Canterbury, and Marlborough, as
we have noted, from Nelson.</p>

<p>Among the cities Christchurch and Dunedin still
stand alone with over sixty thousand inhabitants and
two of the colleges of the University of New Zealand;
while the greater part of the trade of the island passes
through their ports. The districts behind them also
contain the great majority of the sheep reared in the
island. Next in importance to these cities is Invercargill,
with less than twenty thousand inhabitants;
while no other town has more than ten thousand.
These numbers may seem small to us, but we must
remember that they are large in proportion to the total
population of New Zealand, which, including the Maoris,
was less than a million in 1906. In Christchurch, in
addition to the Cathedral and University College, we
find a Supreme Court of the Dominion; and here
we may see also the old Provincial Council Buildings,
a remnant of the former system of government.</p>

<p>Though these capital cities have attracted relatively
large populations, yet there is not that enormous concentration
of life and wealth in a single city which we
noticed in some of the Australian States. The sea is
partly responsible for this. The population tends to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
scatter in a fringe along the coasts, since the natural
means of access to the agricultural and mining districts
of the interior is from the nearest point on the sea-board.
There is no great concentration of routes at
any one point, and though Christchurch and Dunedin
have a long start, many of the smaller towns are
growing rapidly, through the development of the areas
behind them. As we have seen, the whole structure of
the country is against concentration, and the scattering
of the population may become more rather than less
marked as the newer districts are opened up from
the coast inwards. The geographical conditions which
controlled early settlement are still operative to-day.</p>

<p>We have treated of the settlement of South Island
as though the first settlers found the country uninhabited
and were free to develop its resources as
seemed best to them, with no difficulties in the way
except those due to climate and structure. We have
made no mention of the aborigines for the good reason
that less than five per cent. of them are to be found
in South Island; so that the native problem has
never been of a serious character. The chief attraction
for the Maoris lay in the greenstone for their weapons
which the island provided; and though they had a
few settlements on the coast, their number was too
small to form any real obstacle to white occupation.</p>

<p>The character of the climate alone would give
sufficient ground for their avoidance of the island, as
they were a race of immigrants from the warmer regions
to the north; also, as we shall see later, the structure
of the country was not well suited to their habits of
life. The case is very different when we come to deal
with North Island; we shall find the Maori there a
very important element in the history of its development.
On our way from Nelson we shall pass through
the narrow channel between Rangitoto Island and the
mainland, where we shall probably meet “Pelorus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Jack,” the huge pilot fish, or rather dolphin, who
regularly escorts vessels through the strait. He is
protected by Act of Parliament, and is so well known
that he has become a subject of Maori legends. A short <span class="linenum">62</span>
steam from Pelorus Sound across Cook Strait brings us
to North Island and within sight of Wellington.</p>

<span class="fs80">NEW ZEALAND&mdash;NORTH ISLAND</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">We may remember noticing, in our first survey, that
Cook Strait was much shallower than the surrounding
seas, and that there was an evident connexion between <span class="linenum">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1</span>
the North and South Islands of New Zealand. The
strait at one point is narrower than the Strait of Dover,
and the connexion between the two sides is still more
clear when we look at the structure of the land. The
parallel ranges of the Kaikoura Mountains, which we
saw in the north-east corner of South Island, reappear
on the other side of the strait. We can trace
the continuation of the seaward Kaikouras in detached
fragments of highland along the east coast of North
Island; while inland there runs an unbroken range
from the coast at Wellington right up to Cape Runaway
at the eastern corner of the Bay of Plenty. So we have
a backbone in North Island as well as in South Island,
but on the eastern instead of the western side. The
result is that the plains on the east are smaller than
those in South Island. There is one of these plains
behind Wellington and another south of Napier; the
railway runs through them and connects up a whole
string of small agricultural towns. North of Napier
there is no railway, and the country is hilly or mountainous
with few settlements. The whole arrangement
is similar to that which we have seen in South
Island, and is equally dependent on the position and
structure of the main mountain backbone. Napier lies <span class="linenum">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2</span>
at the mouth of an estuary, while Wellington, the only
good port in the south of the island, is in a drowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
river valley, running up between the seaward spurs of
the hills and sheltered by them from the gusty winds
of Cook Strait.</p>

<p>As we steam in from the sea we might well imagine <span class="linenum">3,4</span>
that we were entering one of the fiords of South
Island. The hills come down to the water’s edge so <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 5</span>
that the city which they shelter is somewhat crowded
and cramped for space. The old settlement was on a
terrace up the hill; but a modern port must be close
to the water-level, so the wharves and warehouses <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 6</span>
are built largely on land reclaimed from the foreshore.
In fact, the foundations are piles driven into the mud,
and the buildings in the pictures before us seem to be
growing out of the water. Here is the passenger wharf <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 7</span>
with our steamer, and beyond it the town in the early
morning haze. From the tower of the Customs House
we can obtain a good idea of the business part of the
city. On one side of us are tall buildings, offices, and <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 8</span>
warehouses; on the other are factories, sheds, and railway
sidings, with the harbour and shipping beyond. <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 9</span></p>

<p>It would be a rather ugly city except for the terraced
hill in the background, where we find some of the finest
buildings. If we look closely at some of these, we may
be struck by a remarkable feature in their construction;
many of them are made entirely of wood. The
chief reason for this was the fear of the earthquakes to
which the whole of this district is subject. Here is
another curious result of the same thing. We see a
fine cricket-ground, on which a match is in progress
between Australian and New Zealand teams: the
ground is in the Basin Reserve, which was originally <span class="linenum">10</span>
intended for a dock but was raised in level during the
great earthquake of 1848. The Government offices are
said to be the largest wooden buildings in the world; <span class="linenum">11</span>
notice the curious style of the architecture and contrast
it with some of the many public buildings of stone
which we saw in Australia. Even the Houses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Parliament are of wood. Parliament meets here, since
Wellington is now the capital and seat of Government
for the whole Dominion. The present meeting place <span class="linenum">12</span>
is the old Government House, since the former Parliamentary
Buildings were burnt down in the summer of
1907. Only a fragment of them remains, chiefly the <span class="linenum">13</span>
library which we see in this picture; the marble statue
in front is that of John Ballance, a former Premier of
New Zealand.</p>

<p>Wellington, by its position, is a natural centre for
politics and for trade, whether across the ocean or
round the coasts; it is the chief port of the island and
the starting point of a whole system of railways which
has grown outward from it. As a trading centre,
Auckland comes a good second, and Lyttelton third.</p>

<p>We have noticed already the railway to Napier, <span class="linenum">14</span>
which reminded us somewhat of that in the Canterbury
district. The lines running to the north and
north-west carry us into an entirely new type of
country, and before following them up we must look
carefully at the build of the island on the other side
of the mountain backbone. Here our experience of
South Island will help us little. Instead of a gentle
uniform slope to the ocean, we find a confused and
bewildering structure. The mountain ranges in the
long northern neck and in the Coromandel Peninsula,
with its continuing islands, run from north-west to
south-east, almost at right angles to our main dividing
range. In the broader part of the island these ranges
disappear, and we have a broken plateau in the region
round Lake Taupo with short ranges lying on it in
irregular fashion. We may notice that rivers radiate
from this centre in every direction except the east.
Finally, in the south-west corner, we see an isolated
and symmetrical mountain block. The forces at work
here seem to have been very different from those which
shaped the long ridges of South Island. The Taupo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
district will give us the key to the whole: it is
volcanic and contains active cones, geysers, and hot
springs in great number. There is another contrast:
in the south and west of the island we have no fiords
or inlets, but long, smooth coasts hollowed out into
bights; whereas the north is made up of islands, inlets,
and peninsulas. We shall see later that these differences
in structure have more than a purely geographical
interest, since they have had a most marked influence
on the settlement and history of the island.</p>

<p>Let us now start on our journey by rail and observe
the country as we pass rapidly through it. At first we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
travel through open lands with many prosperous-looking
farms. Then, as we turn northward on the
main trunk line, the scenery gradually changes; there
are rugged hills, plateaus with steep broken edges, and
rivers running at the bottom of narrow gorges. The
whole face of the country looks disturbed and unfinished,
and becomes wilder and more desolate as we
approach the volcanic district in the centre. At
Waiouru, we leave the train and mount a coach which
jolts us sadly over the rough roads. From the station,
looking northward, we can see in the distance the great
cone of Ruapehu, with slopes of dark purple and a <span class="linenum">15</span>
dazzling cap of snow upon the summit. Beyond it are
other cones, one of which, Ngauruhoe, we see here; <span class="linenum">16</span>
and below us, as we drive along, is the Wangaehu,
a narrow stream flowing in a dark grey bed, its waters
heavily charged with sulphur. Further on is the
Waikiti, at the bottom of a deep chasm.</p>

<p>As we draw near to Lake Taupo we notice here and
there puffs of steam rising from the scrub at the side of the
road, and on the roadway we meet Maoris, tattered and
dirty looking. Here we see two of them meeting and <span class="linenum">17</span>
saluting one another by touching noses. At last we
drive on to the jetty at Tokaanu at the southern end
of the lake. There are more Maoris here and on the
steam launch which is to take us to the other end.
Taupo lies right up on the central volcanic plateau,
and we are about to visit part of the great geyser
region a short distance from its northern end. It is
the largest of the lakes of New Zealand, and is interesting
not so much for its beauty, as it has little, but for
its close connexion with Maori history. Here is a view <span class="linenum">18</span>
of the lake looking back towards Tokaanu and the
volcanic range of mountains.</p>

<p>A short drive from the landing place at the northern
end brings us to Wairakei, where we walk down a
pleasant green valley to view the geysers. First we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
visit the Champagne Pool, a little lake with steep red <span class="linenum">19</span>
walls and deposits of white silica on the lower rocks.
Here the water is always bubbling and spouting at a
temperature above boiling point. The deposits of
silica often form beautiful terraces: the most famous
in the world were at Rotomahana, not far from Lake
Rotorua which lies at the north end of our district.
Here are two pictures of the Rotomahana terraces; notice <span class="linenum">20</span>
the people bathing in the hot pools. These great terraces
were destroyed by the eruption of Mount Tarawera <span class="linenum">21</span>
in 1886, but there are many smaller formations of
the same kind to be seen in the district. Here, for <span class="linenum">22</span>
instance, is one gradually being built up round the
Twin Geysers.</p>

<p>Further down the valley we come to the great
Wairakei Geyser which plays for three minutes and
then is quiet for eleven. Here is a distant view from <span class="linenum">23</span>
the opposite bank of the river; and here we see the
geyser at work with great vigour. Notice the curious <span class="linenum">24</span>
projection in the foreground of the last picture;
it is the trunk of a tree, petrified by the deposit
of silica, which is not white here but pale coffee-colour.
There is a rainbow, too, in the vapour above,
which is unfortunately beyond the capacity of our
camera. Other smaller geysers are all round us with
deposits of claret-colour, black and yellow, due to the
different salts dissolved in the hot water. The ground
shakes with the explosions of steam beneath us, and
everywhere is heat and vapour; yet all the time the
cold waters of the Wairakei River are flowing by within
a few feet of us. Scattered over the valley are beautiful
lakes and pools of different colours. Here is one of
them, the Blue Lake, lying in a corner of an old crater; <span class="linenum">25</span>
the perpendicular walls which form the bank in front
of us are white striped with orange.</p>

<p>Everywhere in this district volcanic agencies have
changed the face of nature. In one part we find long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
stretches of grey pumice plains, with no vegetation but
dusty brown fern. In another part, great deposits of <span class="linenum">26</span>
sulphur have been laid down over the earth. It is a
country with a beauty of its own, but more attractive
to the tourist than to the colonist and settler. It still
remains a barrier separating the centres of white settlement
and only recently crossed by the trunk line of
railway.</p>

<p>It was in this wild country, to which the rail and
coach now bring curious visitors from all parts of the
world, that not many years ago the Maoris made their
last stand against British power. East and west of the
lake is the King country of which we hear much in
history; except for the tourist it is still in the main
left to the Maoris.</p>

<p>In Australia, as we have seen, the real obstacles to
settlement were the climate and the character of the
country; the aborigines were pushed back into the
wilder districts or simply crushed out of existence by
the civilisation of the white man. Not so the Maori:
he has been a very important element in the life of
New Zealand, whether as friend or enemy of the white
invader, from the time of the earliest settlers&mdash;the
whalers of Cook Strait, and the traders, boat-builders,
and missionaries of the Bay of Islands which lies on the
east coast of the long northern peninsula. The British
have been settled in New Zealand barely three-quarters
of a century, as the proclamation of annexation dates
only from 1840; while the Maori has been in possession
for five or six centuries at least and shows no disposition
to be crowded out. He was, when first we
met him, on a far higher level than the aborigines of
Australia.</p>

<p>Who, then, are the Maoris? They are a brown race,
a race of seamen who came in their long double canoes
from the islands to the north and settled along the
neck of North Island&mdash;the Fish of Maui as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
called it&mdash;and at Otago and some few other points
in South Island. They brought with them their
island customs, especially the division into families
and clans which were always fighting among themselves.
In New Zealand they found all the materials
for their usual mode of existence: timber for their
houses and sea-going canoes, native flax for the weaving
of clothes, stones for their weapons, as they had no
knowledge of metals; and fish everywhere in the rivers,
lakes, and seas. So here they built their houses, with
little patches of garden for their few vegetables, while
the surrounding country was the common possession of
the clan, whence they added roots, berries, and wild
birds to the larder. Everywhere, in the best positions
for defence, were dotted about their fortified enclosures, <span class="linenum">27</span>
or pahs, in which they took refuge in the numerous clan
feuds. Their religion consisted of a kind of fetichism,
and their whole life was subject to the principle of <em>tapu</em>,
or taboo as we commonly spell it, a principle common
over all this part of the Pacific, and among savage
races elsewhere. The Maoris were chivalrous fighters,
eloquent orators, and careful preservers of the traditions
of their past history. Such was the race which, in the
nineteenth century, contested the settlement of the
island with us.</p>

<p>Here is a portrait of a chief showing the method of <span class="linenum">28</span>
tattooing the face. Here again we see him with his
<em>taiaha</em>, or staff of office: he looks civilised enough <span class="linenum">29</span>
now; in fact, dressed as he is, he might be mistaken
for an Englishman, but doubtless he was very different
in the old days. He is nearly ninety years old, and so
must have seen the settlement and fighting almost
from the very beginning. The building behind the
group is a meeting house of the usual Maori shape,
though the galvanised iron roof seems scarcely to agree
with the elaborate ornamentation of the woodwork.
Notice the curious scroll carving on the fetich pillars:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
it is a favourite design among the Maoris and appears
also in the tattooing of their bodies.</p>

<p>We see the Maori here in European dress and we
find him entering Parliament and the learned professions,
or becoming a successful farmer and grazier in every
way as civilised as ourselves. But he is not anxious to
be a mere imitator of the white man, as he is intensely
proud of his own race and past history. In the remoter
districts he still clings to his ancient fashion of life.
Here is a typical group, in native dress, and here is the <span class="linenum">30</span>
simple private house of a chief. Again we have an
interesting portrait of the daughter of a chief, holding <span class="linenum">31</span>
her father’s heavy staff; her curious dress is largely
made up of the feathers of the wingless Kiwi, which we <span class="linenum">32</span>
have already seen.</p>

<p>The Maori dances are among the most interesting
of their social customs. We may perhaps see the
<em>haka</em>, a survival of the old war-dance, performed by <span class="linenum">33</span>
half-clad warriors. It is now a ceremonial dance of
welcome. Very different is the <em>poi</em>, the pretty action-dance <span class="linenum">34</span>
and song of women and girls, which we may see
in the dancing-house of any native village. We notice
that the costumes of the dancers are made up of native
flax and feathers. The chief native sport is the canoe
race, as the water is everything to the Maori. Here is
one of the huge dug-out war canoes, hewn from a single <span class="linenum">35</span>
tree-trunk, and now becoming somewhat rare; and
here again we see his canoe used to mark the grave of
a chief. <span class="linenum">36</span></p>

<p>We are now in the district south of the Bay of
Plenty and near Lake Rotorua, which we reach by a
railway running up the valley of the Thames. Here
is a typical scene. In the group before us a woman <span class="linenum">37</span>
is smoking a pipe; we may often see the same thing
among the peasants of Ireland. Down below, a crowd <span class="linenum">38</span>
of Maori children are bathing in the stream, while the
tourists watch them from the bridge. The place is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
called Whakarewarewa, a name rather difficult to
pronounce. This is the northern end of the geyser
district, which we have already visited. Here we see <span class="linenum">39</span>
the tourists again, with their cameras, waiting for the
great Wairoa Geyser to start; and here is the geyser <span class="linenum">40</span>
playing. Not far away are some Maori women cooking
by the steam heat provided by nature. <span class="linenum">41</span></p>

<p>The centre of this region is Lake Rotorua, calm and
cold, while all around on its banks are hot springs, geysers
and boiling mud-holes. Here, where a few years ago
was only bush, or primitive village, a fine modern town <span class="linenum">42</span>
has sprung up for the benefit of the tourist in search of
beautiful scenery, or the invalid coming to the health-giving
waters. Not far away is another lake, Rotomahana, <span class="linenum">43</span>
in a huge basin formed by the eruption which
destroyed the famous terraces. Here we may enjoy
the strange experience of boating on boiling water,
with the geysers working all around us. Volcanic
activity is everywhere in this wonderful country, and
it is only natural that round it have gathered countless
Maori legends.</p>

<p>We can easily understand the fondness of the Maoris
for the water. They were a race of islanders and fishermen,
never really happy unless their houses were built
close to the water’s edge. This determined their mode
of settlement; they only took to the dry land of the
interior as a refuge from their enemies. So we found
them, when first we entered the island, scattered along
the narrow part of the Fish, where are bays and inlets
in abundance, and along the coasts of the Bay of Plenty
and the Taranaki Bight. Lake, river, and marsh were
their dwelling places; and when we find them established
of their own will in the interior, it is on the
banks of Lake Taupo, a small sea in their eyes. The
white settler wanted, in the main, the drier districts for
his farms and cattle, that is, the parts of least value
to the Maori; but none the less, settlement was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
effected without a generation of trouble and a long
period of petty warfare.</p>

<p>Down to 1830, except for the missionaries, the
Maoris knew us chiefly through the trading ships which
visited the islands, and the few white men, not real
settlers, who lived the life of the natives and sometimes
took part in their clan feuds. The main occupation of
the Maoris was fighting among themselves; and it was
the petition of some chiefs in the Bay of Islands for
protection from another clan which first led to the
dispatch of a British official from New South Wales.
This official had no real power and depended for his
information as to the natives entirely on the missionary
interpreters. Then a Frenchman intervened, and in
1835 proclaimed himself sovereign of New Zealand,
apparently on the strength of some land which he had
bought years before at Hokianga. This led to a league
of the northern tribes, headed by the missionaries,
which demanded British protection.</p>

<p>Next we hear of a French bishop setting up a mission
at Hokianga, and a French syndicate buying land in
Banks Peninsula, in 1838; while the English Land
Company, started by Gibbon Wakefield, dispatched its
first batch of colonists in the next year. As the
result of these movements, the British Government
was forced to take action, and the Governor of New
South Wales promptly proclaimed our authority over
the whole of New Zealand. His agent, Captain
Hobson, concluded the Treaty of Waitangi, at the
Bay of Islands, in 1840; by this agreement the
native chiefs recognised British suzerainty. South
Island was occupied just in time, as Hobson’s
officers reached the Banks Peninsula only four
days in advance of a French warship and party of
French colonists. So that it was really France which
hurried us on to the effective occupation of New
Zealand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The later history of our relations with the natives
all hinges on the land question. The New Zealand
Company, and many private speculators as well,
bargaining through interpreters, believed that they
had bought enormous areas of land for a mere nothing:
the Maoris imagined that they had sold very little.
Moreover, it was very doubtful who really had the
power to sell the land, since the waste lands of the
Maoris were all held in common. To settle the disputes
the Home Government sent out a special Commissioner
who decided that most of the bargains could not be
allowed to stand. Even so the Maoris found it hard
to appreciate our ideas as to sale and possession of
land. There was endless trouble until Sir George
Grey was sent over from South Australia in 1845,
learnt the native language, and reduced both sides
to order. For comparatively small sums he succeeded
in buying gradually those parts of the country which
were most essential to the white settlers, while leaving
plenty for the support of the original inhabitants; for
we must remember that the Maoris were very few in
proportion to the area of the country. Grey was popular
with the Maoris, and when he left, in 1855, the country
was fairly well organised.</p>

<p>But the land question was not yet finally settled.
In 1857, the Maoris tried to federate under a native
king, the main object of the association being to oppose
the further sale of land to the white settlers. The
whole of Central Maoriland, east and west of Lake Taupo,
was unfriendly to us. The trouble came to a head over
a land claim in the Taranaki district, and the result
was over ten years of raids and casual fighting which
could hardly be called organised war, since it moved
from district to district, and the different tribes had no
common policy or unity. As the sections were subdued
from time to time, the usual penalty inflicted was
confiscation of land; so that by 1870 the whole of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
coast strip, from the north of Hawkes Bay round by
Wellington to the Mokau River on the west, was in our
possession. So, too, was all the land on both sides of
the Lower Waikato, and a narrow fringe along the Bay
of Plenty. Thus there was practically a ring fence
put round Central Maoriland, and until quite recently
there was no connexion between Wellington and
Auckland across this isolated block. Sir George Grey,
who had returned as Governor, in 1861, was largely
responsible for laying down the lines on which the Maori
problem was finally and successfully solved.</p>

<p>One interesting result of the war was that Wellington
became the capital instead of Auckland. Auckland
was the original settlement, moved from the Bay of
Islands in 1842, and marked out by Hobson as the
future capital. By its position it divided the tribes of
the north from those of the south, and this was a great
advantage in the early days of settlement. Port
Nicholson, later Wellington, was founded in the same
year by colonists of the New Zealand Company; while
New Plymouth, in Taranaki, was settled in 1841. So
we have three original and contemporary settlements,
Hawkes Bay being split off from Wellington later. We
have already seen a similar process in South Island.
After 1865, the population of South Island increased
very rapidly, until it exceeded that of North Island,
while the Maoris in the latter were thought to be as
numerous as the white people. It was inevitable that
the capital should be brought nearer the centre of
power of the white population, and so, in 1865, Wellington
was chosen as the capital by a committee of
Australians to which the question was referred.</p>

<p>We have seen the importance of the Taupo district
in past history, and how throughout, as in South
Island, the structure of the country has profoundly
influenced its development and the relations of the
settlers with the Maoris. If instead of travelling up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the trunk line of railway we had continued along the
coast to New Plymouth, we should have realised the
meaning of the purchase and confiscation of the narrow
strip all round. We noticed before how the rivers
radiate from the Taupo district in three directions to
the sea; but in their upper courses they are of no use,
since they flow between forest-clad hills, in deep
gorges, where the stream is often broken by rapids, <span class="linenum">44</span>
such as we see here, on the Upper Waikato. The river
up here does not seem to be of much value for navigation,
and though the scenery is beautiful the river valley
is not attractive to the settler. Lower down it is
different.</p>

<p>We may reach the coast by following the line of the
Wanganui, the most beautiful river in New Zealand.
For scores of miles we rush down, in the little launch.
In one reach the river is swift but smooth, running
between sloping, densely forested banks; in another <span class="linenum">45</span>
steep fern-clad cliffs close in to form a gorge through
which the water foams and swirls in rapids. Above, <span class="linenum">46</span>
we may catch sight of a Maori village; all the way
down we meet canoes, slowly poling against the swift
current; while lively parties of Maoris board us at
every landing. Below Pipiriki the scenery changes,
and near the sea we pass through open level
country dotted with sheep and dairy farms, and these
are steadily pushing the forest rim further back. Along
the coast strip there is a whole string of small agricultural
towns which suggest to us that the country
round is of great value to the farmer. It is the same
all the way to New Plymouth which lies under the
shadow of Mount Egmont, a huge detached volcanic
cone. Everywhere, in the clearings by the railway,
are prosperous-looking dairy farms, the Taranaki district
being specially famous for the quantity and quality
of its dairy produce. Why is this so? The district
is warm, it is also moist, as it lies on the west coast; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
fact Mount Egmont enjoys the heaviest rainfall in the
whole island. Here is a farm in Taranaki with the <span class="linenum">47</span>
mountain in the distance, and here we have a near
view of the great cone. <span class="linenum">48</span></p>

<p>The economic progress of North Island, so far as
we have seen it, has consisted largely in the occupation <span class="linenum">49</span>
of the lowlands near the river mouths, and the
gradual clearing of the forest further inland&mdash;a rather
different forest from that of South Island, since the
climate is warmer and drier. To open up the country
for farming we had to reduce the hunting grounds of
the Maori, and even to drain, in spite of his opposition,
some of his favourite marshes. As a result of the settlement
we find in the south-east, south and south-west,
butter, wool, meat and timber produced in large
quantities; while in the centre we have nothing but
the scenery and some forest as yet untouched.</p>

<p>If we think of the products which are most valuable
to New Zealand at the present day, we shall find that
with the exception of timber they have been introduced
from abroad by the white settlers and were unknown
to the Maoris. But the marshland, dear to the Maori
heart, produces one plant which was necessary to the
natives in the past and is still very useful to us. This
is the New Zealand flax, though it is more like hemp
than the flax from which linen is made in the northern
hemisphere. The Maoris wove the fibre of this plant
into clothes. Here we see the long blade-like leaves <span class="linenum">50</span>
being cut in the swamp; we follow it to the mills
where it is unloaded and sorted into lengths. Inside
the mill it is put through various processes until the
fibre finally appears as a rope or bale of fine white twine <span class="linenum">51</span>
ready for the market. In this form it is sent from the
mill all over the world and commands prices as
high as Manila hemp with which perhaps we are more
familiar.</p>

<p>We will now leave the south and pay a short visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to the northern districts. Here the conditions are somewhat
different. There is gold to be found at the base
of the Coromandel Peninsula, and it is mined largely
from the quartz rock, not merely washed from the
alluvium as in South Island. This has led to the growth
of a group of small mining towns. There is coal, too, in
the basin of the Waikato and in the districts north of
Auckland. The presence of these minerals in itself
would lead us to expect a difference between the north
and south of the island; but the difference extends
further, to the vegetable products of the soil. We are
moving out of the west wind region into the zone
where, as in Victoria, the greater part of the rain falls
in the mild winter, and the summer is dry and hot
though tempered by the nearness of the sea. It is a
land where the orange and the vine grow well, in great
contrast to the cool and moist region in the south
of South Island. Many people find the change from
Auckland to Dunedin or Invercargill very trying to
the constitution.</p>

<p>North Auckland has its forests, but they are different
from those of the south, for here and here alone grows <span class="linenum">52</span>
the Kauri pine. Here is pictured the life of the tree.
First we see it growing proudly in the forest; next <span class="linenum">53</span>
the lumbermen are at work on the huge trunk; finally
the logs are hauled away, and at any of the little <span class="linenum">54</span>
ports of the peninsula we may see the timber ships
loading; here, for instance, is a Norwegian sailing ship <span class="linenum">55</span>
taking in a cargo for Liverpool. The Kauri pine is
responsible too for a curious local industry. The
forests of the past have left masses of gum buried in the
swamps, and many labourers are employed in spearing
or digging for it. They become very expert in finding
likely spots in which to probe. Here we have a group
of Croatian diggers ready to set out for the day’s <span class="linenum">56</span>
work; notice the long slender spears which they
carry and the great swamp saw for digging out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
gum. We may see them scraping the gum and then
follow them home in the evening over the desolate <span class="linenum">57</span>
plain to their primitive camp. It is a strange industry
carried on by these foreigners, and the life seems hard,
but the resin is one of the most useful for making our
varnishes.</p>

<p>We have already noticed the great number of bays
and inlets along the long northern neck of the island.
In the far north is the Bay of Islands, the site of the <span class="linenum">58</span>
earliest settlement, represented now only by the small
town of Russell. Fifty miles further south we have
the deep inlet of Whangarei Harbour, where a port and
a short railway line mark the presence of coal in the
country behind. Finally, on Waitemata Harbour, a
western arm of the wide Hauraki Gulf, stands Auckland, <span class="linenum">59</span>
the former capital and still the largest town in
New Zealand. The population of the city with its
suburbs is now over a hundred thousand. Only eight
miles away by rail is Onehunga, on Manukau Harbour, <span class="linenum">60</span>
a gulf almost landlocked but opening into the waters
of the Tasman Sea.</p>

<p>The best way to appreciate Auckland is to approach
it from the sea. As we steam along the coast
from the north, on our left is the curiously shaped
Rangitoto Island, an extinct volcano; on our right is
a long peninsula, with two low rounded hills, also
volcanic, joined together by a low neck of land on
which stands the suburb of Devonport. Across this
neck we get a brief glimpse of the city standing on two
groups of small hills with narrow valleys running down
to the harbour between them. Then we turn round the
North Head and suddenly the whole bay, two miles
broad, opens out before us. On our left are the residential
suburbs of Remuera and Parnell, with houses
and gardens running down to the water’s edge; further
up the bay is the main city with its long quays busy with
traffic, and large steamers anchored in the deep channel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Beyond are more suburbs, and we can follow the winding
inlet for fifteen miles through beautiful scenery which
reminds us somewhat of Port Jackson. On the north
side again another city is growing up, so that Auckland
seems to be built round a great lake, open at the two
ends. The air is clear and free from smoke and everywhere
the sparkling blue water reflects the bright
sunshine. Here we see Auckland, looking across the <span class="linenum">61</span>
water from Devonport, and here we look down on it
from Mount Victoria. <span class="linenum">62</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i142.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Auckland.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Auckland, for its beauty, has been styled the
Naples of the South, and, like Naples, it has its volcanoes.
We have noticed some of these already, and
in the neighbouring country over sixty small cones,
such as the one before us, can be counted within <span class="linenum">63</span>
a radius of ten miles. Even the hills on which the
city stands are partly built up of volcanic debris.
Fortunately for Auckland the volcanoes are no longer
active, and it lacks also the picturesque dirt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
squalor of Naples. It is modern, clean and prosperous.
It has also something more than beautiful scenery to
recommend it. Though it suffered in some ways by
the removal of the capital to Wellington, it is still, and
is likely to remain the chief port-of-call in the Dominion.
It is near to Sydney and is the natural centre for the
trade of the neighbouring Pacific islands. It is the
last port of departure for vessels sailing between
Australia and America; and when the Panama Canal
is finished, it will stand on the shortest route from the
eastern United States to Sydney and Melbourne, and
an alternative route to the Suez Canal for the United
Kingdom and the whole of Western Europe. It is the
chief link connecting New Zealand with the outer world,
and a fit point of departure for our final cruise among
the islands to the north.</p>

<span class="fs80">FIJI AND THE WESTERN PACIFIC</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">We started our tour with the great continental land-mass
of Australia; we shall end it with a visit to some
of the many hundred scattered islands of the Pacific
which are under British control and protection. <span class="linenum">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1</span>
North-east from Auckland, for a thousand miles, we
steam through the open ocean, sighting no land
except perhaps the lonely Kermadec Islands, which
are, as we have seen, attached to the Government of
New Zealand, until we reach the fringe of the many
groups of coral islands and reefs which fill so much
of the Western Pacific. We shall touch first at Tonga
Tabu, the southernmost and largest of the Friendly
Islands, as Captain Cook called them, which lie just
north of the Tropic of Capricorn and rather more
than halfway round the globe eastward from London.</p>

<p>At Auckland we left behind us hills and fiords;
on our right as we enter this group is the small but
high volcanic island of Eua, the only one in the whole
group which contains a river; the main island, Tonga
Tabu, or Holy Tonga, lies on our left, and has a very
different aspect. A low mass, green with what prove to
be coconut palms, rises out of white surf and spray
breaking over reefs of coral rock. We round a low
headland and thread our way through winding channels
among the reefs; on one side is the low mainland, on
the other a string of green islets capping the reefs.
After anchoring in the roadstead for a visit from the <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 2</span>
doctor we are hauled alongside the little ferro-concrete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
wharf. Beyond is a picturesque white town, Nukualofa, <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 3</span>
the capital of the island.</p>

<p>At the wharf half the population seems to be gathered
to meet us. Some are clothed, native fashion, in the
famous Polynesian mats or in the bark-cloth called
<em>tapa</em>, or even in cotton; others are in European dress.
The town with its white houses and verandas looks
quite civilised. The inhabitants remind us of the
New Zealand Maoris, though their colour is somewhat
lighter; in fact, both peoples belong to the same
great family, the Polynesians, or light-brown people
of the Pacific, which is spread over many of the island
groups which lie to the north-east and east of Tonga.
It is this race which roused the admiration of early
voyagers in these regions, both for its physical appearance
and its character.</p>

<p>The Friendly Islands, though a British Protectorate,
and, as regards all matters in which European interests
are involved, under the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner
of the Pacific, still have a native king and
Parliament. The inhabitants are Christians, and are in
a sense the most school-taught people in the Pacific.
They seem to delight especially in mathematics and
music, while shorthand is their usual method of writing.
Tonga was the last of the independent kingdoms to
come under European control. It was left to us as
the result of our negotiations with Germany, at the
end of the nineteenth century, and is now practically
an integral part of our Empire in the Pacific. During
the fifty years before we assumed control, it had made
rather remarkable progress, under its native ruler,
King George Tubou I., in the adoption, or perhaps the
imitation, of Western ideas. This was largely due to
the Wesleyan missionaries, and especially to the work
of one missionary who occupied the post of Prime
Minister.</p>

<p>We will now land and pay a call on the father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the present king. He receives us in civilised fashion <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 4</span>
on the veranda of his house, but we notice that chairs
are provided only for the guests; the rest sit on the
ground in native fashion. A bowl of <em>kava</em> is brewed
for us by pounding, squeezing and straining out the
juice of a root of a plant belonging to the family of the
pepper-worts. It is the native substitute for alcohol,
the use of which by any but white people is strictly
forbidden in Tonga. Without <em>kava</em> drinking, no
social ceremony is considered complete, even to-day;
and it has played an important part in the political
and religious gatherings of the past.</p>

<p>Let us now look round the island. It is only about <span class="linenum">(2)</span>
thirty miles long and ten wide, shaped rather like the
human foot, with two bays running far inland in the
broadest part. The streets and the sea front of Nukualofa
are mostly covered with short grass, and the town
is partly hidden in the groves of coconut palms. It is
the same all over the island. In the drier season we
can follow broad grass tracks, for the most part
running round the island; on both sides of us is a dense
growth of palms, bananas, and tropical trees, such as
we see in the picture before us. Everything is moist <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 5</span>
and green and flat; yet, in Tonga Tabu, as in all the
islands of this particular group, except Eua, we find
no rivers, since the island is merely a block of coral
rock, with a thin covering of rich soil, raised a few feet
above the level of the sea. It is a form of coral island
very common in this part of the Pacific.</p>

<p>We now leave Tonga Tabu for the northern islands
of the group. Our decks are crowded with passengers.
The natives are fond of travelling, and camp out on
our vessel with a miscellaneous collection of luggage
and food, including a number of pigs. We are bound
for the Haapai Group, through a mass of small islets
and foaming reefs; but away to the west rise several
lofty volcanoes, some of which are still active. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
are touching here one of the great volcanic lines of
the world, a line which we have already seen continued
in New Zealand. Off one of these islands, Tofua,
was the scene of the famous mutiny of the <i>Bounty</i>.</p>

<p>We come to anchor on the leeward side of Haapai,
at the one town, called Lifuka. There is no wharf here,
and we lie a long way from the shore, as we see in this <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 6</span>
picture. We may land in the launch or in one of the
native boats which come out to meet us; and we can <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 7</span>
survey the whole island in a short walk, as although
it is five miles long it is less than two miles wide at the
point where Lifuka stands. There is the same rich
foliage and tropical fruit as in Tonga Tabu, but if
we cross the island to the windward side we shall see
a difference from our calm anchorage on the west.
Here the south-east Trade Wind is blowing on-shore
and the rollers are pounding incessantly and breaking <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 8</span>
into surf against the coral rocks. It is a contrast
which we find in most of the islands in this region.</p>

<p>We must hurry on to Vavau, the most northerly of
the three main groups of the Friendly Islands. Here
the main island is hilly, with high limestone cliffs and
ridges. It is the top of a vast mass, heaved up by
volcanic agency from the depths of the Pacific. So
we have Vavau Sound, studded with islands and
protected from the sea by cliffs and headlands running
out on either hand. Here is a view of the Sound; <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 9</span>
it may remind us perhaps of a Scottish loch, until we
notice the coconut trees covering the hills and coming
right down to the water’s edge. Gradually the Sound
narrows, and after a rather abrupt turn we enter the
landlocked harbour of Niafu, with its little wharf and <span class="linenum">10</span>
its group of houses buried in the trees. There are
palms and bananas here as in the other islands, but
Vavau is especially the home of the orange. The
whole country round is a mass of orange trees, and
the ripe fruit strews the grassy roads on which we walk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
The picture is spoilt somewhat, especially near the
town, by the style of the buildings. There is timber
from New Zealand on the jetty, and the native grass
and reed hut is giving place to the wooden house with
galvanised iron roof, which is ugly and not well suited
to the climate. The importance of Vavau lies in its
deep and safe harbour, in a part of the world where
such are somewhat rare.</p>

<p>Many of the islands of this part of the Pacific are often
inaccessible, even for small vessels. Here we have
an interesting method of landing on them; the figure <span class="linenum">11</span>
in the water is a native postman, who is swimming
from our steamer to the island and carrying the mails
sealed up in a water-tight can. The natives are fine
swimmers and as much at home in the water as on the
land.</p>

<p>From Vavau, we turn north-west, and after crossing
about two hundred miles of open ocean reach the
Lau Islands. These are the easternmost of the Fiji
Islands and are, in Fiji, often spoken of as the Windward
Islands. Here is one of the islands of this group:
notice the white line of the fringing coral reef. <span class="linenum">12</span></p>

<p>In this part of our voyage we follow the course
of the Trade Wind, as the Tongans have done for many
generations, and the missionaries after them. As a
consequence of the easy voyage down wind, the Tongans
have had great influence on Fijian affairs in the past;
they even established for themselves a kingdom, in
the Lau Group, shortly before Fiji was taken over by
Britain. Great navigators though they were, they had
less skill than the Fijians in boat-building and carpentry;
so they came to Fiji for their canoes. In Fiji canoe-building
is a hereditary occupation. In former times they
used great twin canoes, with a deck between; but now
the usual form is a single canoe with raised sides and <span class="linenum">13</span>
a solid outrigger, and carrying mat sails. This canoe
is capable of great speed, though it does not look very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> <span class="linenum">14</span>
safe. It is giving place now to boats of a European
type.</p>

<p>The Fiji Islands, the most important group in this <span class="linenum">15</span>
part of the Pacific, are really the higher parts of a
great bank in the ocean; the bank is fringed by reefs
and coral islands, and in the middle is the Koro Sea,
like a vast lagoon, with a wide opening to the south.
On the western side of the bank are the islands of Viti
Levu and Vanua Levu; these names, in the Fijian
language, mean respectively the “Great Viti” and
the “Great Land.” These two islands are by far the
largest in the group. Both are volcanic, with high
mountains and long rivers, and are quite different
from the ordinary coral island.</p>

<p>We touch first at Ovalau, a small volcanic island
eight miles by six. It lies some fifteen miles off the
nearest point of Viti Levu, from which it is separated
by shallow water much interrupted by reefs. Here is
a view from our steamer of one end of Ovalau. We <span class="linenum">16</span>
are approaching Levuka town, which stands on a
narrow strip of lowland hemmed in by a wall of <span class="linenum">17</span>
mountains. Levuka was one of the earliest settlements
of the white traders, and at a later period was the
capital of the group; but we can see that there is
little room for expansion. So the capital has been
transferred to Suva, on the southern side of Viti
Levu, where the conditions are very different. Before
leaving the island let us have a glimpse of the western
side. Here we see a typical coast village; across the <span class="linenum">18</span>
narrow strait is another island, and beyond it in the
distance rise the heights of the mainland.</p>

<p>On our way from Ovalau to Suva we pass near the
tiny islet of Bau, which is so near the mainland of Viti
Levu that we can walk almost dry-shod from one to
the other at low tide. Bau, small as it is, was once
the stronghold of the most powerful of the Fijian
chiefs from which they long effectually resisted both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Tongans and Europeans. The importance of Bau has
departed, but its chiefs are still looked up to as the
real aristocrats of the group, and their way of talking
is the standard for classical Fijian.</p>

<p>After passing Bau and the wide mouth of the Rewa <span class="linenum">19</span>
River, we reach Suva, which lies on the margin of a
wide bay almost enclosed by the protecting reef which
we see in the foreground of the picture. Inside the reef
is a spacious and safe anchorage for small or large
vessels. Here is a panoramic view of the harbour; <span class="linenum">20</span>
and here are some native vessels; notice that their
cargo consists of bananas. The houses are partly <span class="linenum">21</span>
hidden in the trees, so that the streets are very
different from our own. Here is a street scene:
notice that the women in the foreground are Hindus. <span class="linenum">22</span>
The Fijians are darker in colour than the Tongans, and
many still retain their strange national habit of wearing
their hair frizzed out in a huge mop. They differ
from both of the two great races of this part of the
Pacific, from the Friendly Islanders whom we saw to
the east and from the Solomon Islanders whom we shall
presently see to the west. In fact, the Fijians are
almost certainly a mixture of these two races, with the
addition of yet other strains.</p>

<p>We should expect that the mode of life and the
history of the Fijians would differ from that of the
inhabitants of the small coral islands, since they have
for their home a comparatively large area of land with
marked geographical peculiarities. Viti Levu is over <span class="linenum">23</span>
eighty miles from east to west and sixty from north
to south. It is a land of mountain and river; whereas
the ordinary coral island has no rivers worth the
name. A range of rugged mountains runs along the
northern coast, at no great distance from the sea,
the highest point being Mount Victoria, which rises
to 4500 feet. It is from this part of the island that
the long rivers Rewa and Singatoka flow to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
south-east, and a smaller stream, the Ba, to the
north-west. The third largest river, the Navua, rises
in other heights towards the south of the island,
which we shall visit later. Here is a scene on the <span class="linenum">24</span>
Navua. The Rewa is long and winding, but it is
navigable for shallow draught steamers for about forty
miles from its mouth. The whole of the south-eastern
part of the island is wet and was originally covered
with forest; but the coast-lands to the north-west,
under the lee of the mountain ridges, are drier and
more open, as we may judge from this picture. We <span class="linenum">25</span>
can look across the forest, with its dense undergrowth
of fern and creeper, and narrow trails along which we
walk, and see in the distance the outlines of the jagged <span class="linenum">26</span>
mountains of old volcanic rock. There are no active
volcanoes in the island, though hot springs in many
parts show that volcanic activity is not yet entirely
exhausted. Here are some of these springs. <span class="linenum">27</span></p>

</div>

<p>Rivers have been an important element in the
making of Fijian history, since it is in the fertile soil
of the river deltas that the crops of the natives flourish
best. Breadfruit and coconuts, together with the
roots of the taro and the spindle-shaped yam form
their principal food. The taro grows best in the wet
districts, or where there is running water; so that
the natives have long been familiar with simple methods
of irrigation. These staple foods are supplemented by
many kinds of wild tropical fruits and roots. The
natives have pigs and fowls, but these are kept for
state occasions; fish is the only usual non-vegetable
food. The Fijians are clever fishermen, whether using
the spear or arrow or net, or the fish-fences which they
build in the estuaries of the rivers. In fact, the island
provides them amply with all the food which they
need, though sometimes there is a shortage as they
lack means to preserve it. The taro and yams are
stored in earth-covered heaps, as we store potatoes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and some of the vegetable food supply, especially
breadfruit, is buried in pits and used in a partially
fermented state. Here we have a formal presentation <span class="linenum">28</span>
of food, yams and turtle and the <em>yangona</em> root for
making the native drink called here <em>yangona</em> but
elsewhere <em>kava</em>. It is a typical Fijian scene.</p>

<p>The native is content to cultivate his patch of land
with simple implements, such as the digging stick,
and is not anxious to work harder than is necessary for
his own needs. He is not very ready to work for a
European employer, while all his traditions, and the
communal system under which he lives, make it impossible
for the industrious individual to accumulate
any private property.</p>

<p>The cultivation of produce for export is due to the
initiative of Europeans, and is largely carried on by
the East Indian immigrants who now form a very
considerable element in the population. We have
already noticed the Hindu women in the streets of
Suva. For a few years, during the American Civil
War, Fiji exported excellent cotton, but at the present
day its export trade consists practically of sugar,
copra or dried coconut, and bananas. The sugar-cane
is a native of the wet and fertile lowlands of the deltas;
but the cultivated kinds are mostly introduced from elsewhere.
We find the cane fields covering much of the
land along certain parts of the coast, and on the river
deltas of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu; and these are
connected by nearly two hundred miles of steam tramways,
which carry the cane to the centrally placed
mills. Here is a view across the Rewa, showing a <span class="linenum">29</span>
sugar mill; inside the ugly buildings we find the
elaborate European machinery for extracting the juice <span class="linenum">30</span>
from the cane. Here again we are in the cane fields
with Indian women at work. It is all unlike the native <span class="linenum">31</span>
agriculture, though it is very profitable to Fiji, since
sugar is the most valuable of all its exports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The coconut industry is far more picturesque; it is
chiefly confined to the south side of Vanua Levu and to
Taveuni and the other islands. The nut is grown for
its kernel, which, when dried, is called copra, and yields
the coconut oil which we use for various purposes.
The tree grows everywhere in this region, but does not
flourish in Viti Levu owing to an insect pest which
seems peculiar to that island. The nut has always
been much used by the natives for food, but it is now
carefully cultivated for the production of copra. Here <span class="linenum">32</span>
is a plantation with the bungalow of the planter;
notice the hills in the background; here again is a <span class="linenum">33</span>
tree carrying its fruit in curious clusters just below
the crown of leaves. The natives, who are excellent
climbers, swarm up the taller trees to gather <span class="linenum">34</span>
any fruit which is wanted in a not quite ripe state, as
for eating or drinking; but the bulk of the nuts,
intended for copra, are allowed to ripen on the tree
until they drop off. The ripe nuts are then cut open, <span class="linenum">35</span>
the kernels extracted and dried in great trays and
put into bags for shipment.</p>

<p>We will now leave the coast for a short trip inland,
to see something of the country and the people in their
more primitive condition and less mixed type. We
travel up the Rewa river for about twenty miles, and
there turn westward across country. We have left
behind the steamer and the European trader and
planter and plunge suddenly into a strange and wild
world. At our first stopping place we are entertained
with a display which reminds us that a very short time
ago the Fijians were fierce fighters and cannibals. This
is the <em>meke</em> or native war-dance and song, now only
an interesting survival. First we see the dancers in
the distance, entering the village in two lines. Their <span class="linenum">36</span>
faces are hideous with lampblack and vermilion, and
they wear strange-looking dresses made of leaves. They
go through many complicated evolutions. They rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
towards us, stabbing with their long spears and swinging
their formidable clubs, and as suddenly rush away.
They stamp and charge and shout and imitate all the
movements of a battle. Finally they subside quietly. <span class="linenum">37</span>
The women also have their special dance, of which we
have here a picture. The war-dance is now only a <span class="linenum">38</span>
game, but it was far different before our occupation
of the islands. Though we still utilise the old tribal
organisation, and govern them through their native
chiefs and councils, we have forced the Fijians
to understand that fighting, raids and massacres are
an amusement no longer permitted. The constabulary, <span class="linenum">39</span>
which we see here with their rifles and maxim guns,
serve generally only in the coast regions, where they
represent a form of law and order which the Fijians
readily understand; but even in the interior certain
Fijians, less formally organised into a sort of rural
police, keep effective order. Our little trip might not
have been so safe or pleasant forty years ago.</p>

<p>We now leave the Rewa and strike across country
south-westward. Our road is a mere track, and often
we find streams to be crossed but no bridges to help
us. To our carriers this does not matter, as they are
not overburdened with clothes. They plunge in and <span class="linenum">40</span>
wade through the shallows, and they will carry us if
necessary. On the wider streams canoes must be
used, or a bamboo raft lashed roughly together. We
may notice that our carriers have slung our baggage
on poles carried on the shoulders of one or two men;
this is the regular native means of transport, for carts
are only used near the plantations, and by Europeans,
where roads are available. In the old time the women
would have carried the burdens, as it was thought
beneath the dignity of a man to carry anything but
his weapons.</p>

<p>Presently we reach a village where we discover an
interesting native industry, the making of mats from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> <span class="linenum">41</span>
a kind of reed. Here we see girls at work weaving
the mats, and in one of the native huts they are making
baskets from the same material. The Fijians are clever
at this work, and both mats and baskets are important
articles in their daily life. They also used to make a
peculiar but very artistic pottery, such as we do not
find in the islands of Polynesia further east; but this <span class="linenum">42</span>
art is no longer practised except in a few places, and
for the production of pots for domestic use.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most noteworthy native manufacture
is that of <em>tapa</em> cloth for their dress. <em>Tapa</em> is made by
beating out the fibrous bark of the paper mulberry,
and sometimes of certain other trees. The art is known
in Polynesia generally, and the Fijians, like many of
the other islanders, also print the cloth in various
patterns and colours.</p>

<p>We continue our march, passing many villages.
Here is a corner in one of them; notice the native huts <span class="linenum">43</span>
of grass and reeds, very different from the wood and
corrugated iron of Suva. Notice, too, the coconut
palms growing all around. Here again we have a <span class="linenum">44</span>
more elaborately finished house, in the old style; and
here is the interior of the home of a chief; it looks <span class="linenum">45</span>
somewhat unfurnished to our eyes, though it is cool
and airy. At the next village the natives receive us
with a solemn presentation of food and <em>yangona</em> in a
rather dark hut. Here they are making the <em>yangona</em>. <span class="linenum">46</span>
Finally we reach Namosi, a picturesque native town
perched up in the mountains. The town lies in a kind
of pass between steep rocks, the “Gate of Namosi,” as <span class="linenum">47</span>
we see in the picture. The inhabitants are summoned
together by the beating of the town drum, a hollow log
of wood, and receive us sitting on the ground beneath <span class="linenum">48</span>
an ancient tree. We have reached the limit of our
journey; but short though it is, it has given us some
idea of the real Fijian as he is to-day, away from
direct European influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The conditions in the other large island, Vanua
Levu, are much the same as in Viti Levu. The island
is long and narrow, but with the same irregular mountain
structure, the same vegetation and the same
contrast of wet and dry on the opposite coasts. We
may remember that Ovalau, off the coast of Viti Levu,
was much concerned in the past with the politics of
the neighbouring mainland; the same was true of
Taveuni off Vanua Levu. The dwellers on the rich
coastlands of the larger islands led a very uncertain
life between the raiders from the sea and the wild tribes
of the interior. The sea was always the more important
factor in the life of the whole group of islands; it united,
while the land more often divided. We have already
noted its importance in the relations of Fiji and the
Friendly Islands.</p>

<p>Before we leave Fiji it is interesting to note that
the line which divides East from West passes through
this group, cutting the island of Taveuni into two; so
that in one part of Taveuni we can stand with one
foot in the East and the other in the West, or in other
words, one foot may be in a place nearly twenty-four
hours ahead of that occupied by the other according
to Greenwich Time.</p>

<p>The Fiji Islands are governed as a Crown Colony&mdash;the
only Colony so governed in the Pacific; and hitherto
the Governor of that Colony has also been High Commissioner
for the Western Pacific, that is to say, he has
been in charge of most of the scattered islands in the
Pacific which are more or less under British protection.
We have already visited one of his charges, the Friendly
or Tongan Islands. The number of these islands
under the High Commissioner is very great, but
unfortunately there is no regular means of communication
between Fiji and most of them. Every month
a steamer starts from Auckland, calls at Tonga Tabu,
Haapai and Vavau, and then goes on to Levuka and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Suva, exactly along the route which we have followed.
But from Suva this steamer goes on to Sydney in
Australia. Once a month, too, a steamer starts from
Sydney, along the same route but in the reverse direction,
to Auckland. With none of the other islands is
there any direct means of communication; and when
the High Commissioner wishes to visit them he must go
round in a warship. We will accompany him on one
of these tours, in order to see something of the other
British islands.</p>

<span class="smcap">Funafuti.</span><br />
<span class="fs80">The dotted portion represents the coral reefs, the black portion land,<br />

</div>

<p>Starting from Suva we steam a little west of north,
along the chain of the Ellice and Gilbert Islands,
which reaches quite up to the equator. These islands
are all coral atolls; Funafuti, in the Ellice Group,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
serves as a type of all the rest. It consists of a lagoon, <span class="linenum">49</span>
about twelve miles across, roughly circular and surrounded
by a reef; the top of this reef appears here
and there above water in the form of coral islets, the
largest of which is Funafuti proper. The whole atoll
is merely the coral-rimmed summit of a huge mountain
rising from the great depths of the Pacific. Funafuti
is a complicated atoll; many of the smaller islands
of the Fijian group are volcanic, and show a different
kind of structure. In these we sometimes find the
old crater filled with water, while the remnants of the
slopes of the volcano form the shores of the lagoon.
A good instance of this structure is Totoya, towards <span class="linenum">50</span>
the south-east of the Fijian group. Here the enclosing
rim rises to over a thousand feet, but the sea has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
broken through on the south and formed a lagoon.
The entrance is almost closed by the coral reef which
encircles the whole of the outside of the island. Coral
reefs grow everywhere if the water is shallow enough,
so that we find reefs not only around the coasts of the
islands but growing on banks which are isolated and
entirely covered by the sea.</p>

<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Totoya.</span><br />
<span class="fs80">The dotted portions represent coral reefs.</span></div>
</div>

<p>North of the Ellice Islands are the Gilberts, arranged
also in rows from south-east to north-west. They,
too, are coral atolls, with a thin soil which will grow
nothing but coconuts and screw pines; none the less,
on coconuts and fish a fairly dense population supports
itself. They are, as we might expect, less civilised here
than in the larger islands which we have visited further
south.</p>

<p>From the Gilberts we turn south-west to visit another
great row of islands, the Solomons and New Hebrides.
On our way we pass Ocean Island, a small dot isolated
from the rest of the Gilbert Group. Here we find, in
addition to the natives, a considerable number of Europeans.
The island is being exploited commercially, but
instead of making copra they are digging out valuable
deposits of phosphates. Here are some of the natives, <span class="linenum">51</span>
and here is a picture showing the excavation of the
phosphatic coral rock. <span class="linenum">52</span></p>

<p>Ocean Island has for us a further interest. North-west
of it lies Nauru, where also phosphates are obtained.
Nauru belongs to Germany, and the dividing
line between the British and German spheres runs
between the two islands. If we follow the line south-west,
we see that it cuts through the Solomons and
then turns sharply west to New Guinea which it
divides roughly into halves. Germany shares with the
United States the Samoa Islands, north-east of Tonga,
but her main sphere of influence is in this western
area.</p>

<p>On our voyage to the Solomons we pass another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
curious island, or rather group of islands. This is
Ongtong Java, where the people differ from those of
the islands which we have visited up to this point.
We are approaching a region where we know little of
the character and origin of the natives, a region more
backward and savage than any other part of our
dominions in the Pacific.</p>

<p>The Solomons consist of a double row of long and
narrow islands, with high mountain ridges and many
volcanoes, some extinct, others still active. The largest
island, Bougainville, at the north end, is German;
the rest are British. They have long been known to
explorers, but until recently their history tells chiefly
of resistance by the natives against Europeans who
have attempted to open up intercourse with them.
Lately, thanks to the good influence of the missionaries,
and perhaps still more to the better regulations made
by the agents of the British Government for intercourse
between the wild men and the Europeans, considerable
advance has been made, and plantations of coconut
and other valuable products have been established
in many of the larger islands. Many of the tribes,
however, are still head-hunters and cannibals. The
islands are covered with great forests, and the plants
and animals, as well as the natives, resemble to some
degree those found in New Guinea. The people go
naked for the most part, except for necklaces and
bracelets of shells and teeth. Their houses are often
built on piles, like those of the Papuans. Here we see <span class="linenum">53</span>
a group engaged in a war-dance, and here is one of
their curiously ornamented canoes. <span class="linenum">54</span></p>

<p>South-east of the Solomons we pass the Santa Cruz
Group; the name, as do many other names in this
part of the world, reminds us again of the early voyages
of de Quiros the Spaniard, who at the end of the
sixteenth century first discovered these distant islands.
Spain has disappeared from this part of the Pacific,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and the region of islands is divided between Germany
to the north, Britain in the Solomons, and Britain
and France in the New Hebrides.</p>

<p>Southward from Santa Cruz we pass almost at once
the northernmost of the long chain of the New Hebrides,
discovered towards the end of the eighteenth century,
almost simultaneously, by our own Captain Cook and
by the great French admiral Bougainville. Northernmost
of all, in the sphere of joint Anglo-French influence,
we pass the Torres and Banks Islands, great centres
of the famous Melanesian mission. Next we come to
Espiritu Santo, or Santo for short, at the northern end
of which is the great Bay of St. Philip and St. James,
within which, four centuries ago, Quiros built a town&mdash;a
town which lasted but a few months. He rejoiced
greatly because he thought that in that newly discovered
land he had reached the beginning of the
great Southern Continent which was supposed to extend
thence to the Antarctic regions.</p>

<p>Here and there round Santo there are a few mission
stations, and a few fairly prosperous plantations, some
English and some French; but the natives in the
interior are still very wild and occasionally raid the
European settlements. Here we see a vast crowd of
natives celebrating a feast. Now it is a peaceful <span class="linenum">55</span>
ceremony: it was far different in the past.</p>

<p>Next, still steaming southward, we pass between
two rows of islands, until, about where the two rows
join, we come to the Island of Efate, with its growing
town of Vila, the centre of Anglo-French administration.
Here is the seat of the Joint Court, and many
buildings of almost European type have recently been
erected for its use.</p>

<p>Still further south the New Hebrides reach, now in
a single line, almost down to the Loyalty Islands and
New Caledonia. These last two places are, however,
purely French possessions, and we may pass them by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>From Vila the Governor in his warship would probably
return eastward to Fiji. We may leave him at
Vila and take either the French or the British steamer,
which calls there once a month, and so make our way
direct to Sydney. But before leaving the subject of
the New Hebrides we may note that the islands of this
group are largely volcanic, and the people are not
unlike those of the Solomons, though perhaps rather
less savage. Here we have a picture showing their <span class="linenum">56</span>
former method of receiving visitors. It was from these
two groups that the brown labour for the Queensland
plantations was largely recruited in times past. The
New Hebrides are fertile, though not healthy for
Europeans; and when they have been reduced to
some order by white administration they may develop
a trade with Australia in various vegetable products;
since they are not limited to the coconut as are so
many of the coral atolls. The picture before us with <span class="linenum">57</span>
its coral reefs, its forest and its background of volcanic
hills, gives a very good idea of the scenery of these
islands.</p>

<p>We have now completed the circuit of our chief
possessions in the Western Pacific. There still remain
a few detached islands and groups on its eastern
borders which are under the jurisdiction of the High
Commissioner. Of these only two are of much interest.</p>

<p>Fanning Island lies almost in mid-Pacific, and halfway
along the usual route from Sydney to Vancouver.
A steamer from Sydney travels 1700 miles to its first
stop at Suva; then 1900 on to Fanning Island; thence
3400 to Vancouver, the starting place of the Canadian-Pacific
route to Europe. Fanning Island is in consequence
the mid-Pacific station of the Pacific cable. The
island and its near neighbour, Washington Island, are
small coral islands with lagoons, on which coconuts
have long been profitably cultivated. Both also have
valuable deposits of phosphates, due to the age-long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
deposit of the droppings of countless seabirds on the
decomposing coral. These phosphates, as well as the
very abundant coconuts, are already exported, and
their value is likely to increase considerably before
long. Moreover, the probability that Fanning Island
may be made into a shelter and repairing station for
vessels crossing the Pacific adds largely to its value
as an asset of the Empire. Here are two pictures of <span class="linenum">58</span>
the island, typical of the kind of coral atoll which
is found isolated in the Pacific, instead of being, as are <span class="linenum">59</span>
most of the others which we have seen, a member of
a group.</p>

<p>Far away to the south-east, almost on the Tropic, <span class="linenum">60</span>
and halfway to South America, lies the lonely Pitcairn
Island, to which a few other scattered islets, British
possessions, are attached. Pitcairn has a population
of about a hundred and fifty souls, descendants of the
mutineers of the <i>Bounty</i>, who settled here with their
native wives in 1789. The present occupants represent
those who returned after the experiment of removing
to Norfolk Island in 1856. They had found themselves
overcrowded, since Pitcairn is a tiny island only two
miles long by three-quarters wide, rocky and volcanic,
though fertile. The island is of great interest from the
point of view of the history of the Pacific, since there
are remains on it of stone monuments, weapons, and
images which prove that even in this distant corner
of the ocean some early people must have settled long
before the Polynesians. In fact, there are traces of <span class="linenum">61</span>
such settlements all over the Pacific, which suggest
that the Polynesians themselves are merely modern
colonists, occupying the homes of an earlier and perhaps
more civilised race.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
